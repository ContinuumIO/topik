Data Import
###########

Data import loads your data from some external representation into an iterable,
internal representation for Topik. The main front end for importing data is the
:func:`~.read_input` function:


.. code-block:: python

   >>> from topik import read_input
   >>> corpus = read_input(source="data_file.json", content_field="text")


:func:`~.read_input` is a front-end to several potential reader backends. Presently,
:func:`~.read_input` attempts to recognize which backend to use based on some
characteristics of the source string you pass in. These criteria are:

  * ends with .js or .json: treat as JSON stream filename first, fall back to
    "large JSON" (such as file generated by esdump).
  * contains 9200: treat as `Elasticsearch` connection address (9200 is the
    default `Elasticsearch` port).
  * result of os.path.splitext(source)[1] is "": treat as folder of files. Each
    file is considered raw text, and its contents are stored under the key given
    by content_field. Files may be gzipped.

Any of the backends can also be forced by passing the source_type argument with
one of the following string arguments:

  * elastic
  * json_stream
  * large_json
  * folder

The ``content_field`` is a mandatory argument that in most cases specifies where the
actual content to be analyzed will be drawn from. For all hierarchical data
sources (everything except folders), this accesses some subfield of the data you
feed in.


JSON additional options
=======================

For JSON stream and "large JSON" inputs, an additional keyword argument may be
passed, ``json_prefix``, which is the period-separated path leading to the single
content field. This is for content fields not at the root level of the JSON
document. For example, given the JSON content:

.. code-block:: javascript

    [ {"nested": {"dictionary": {"text": "I am the text you're looking for."} } } ]


You would read using the following ``json_prefix`` argument:


.. code-block:: python

   >>> corpus = read_input(source="data_file.json", content_field="text",
                           json_prefix="nested.dictionary")


`Elasticsearch` additional options and notes
============================================

The `Elasticsearch` importer expects a full string specifying the `Elasticsearch`
server. This string at a minimum must contain both the server address and the
index to access (if any). All results returned from the `Elasticsearch` query
contain only the contents of the '_source' field returned from the query.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> corpus = read_input(source="https://localhost:9200", index="test_index", content_field="text")


Extra arguments passed by keyword are passed to the `Elasticsearch` instance
creation. This can be used to pass additional login parameters, for example, to
use SSL:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> corpus = read_input(source="https://user:secret@localhost:9200",
                           index="test_index", content_field="text", use_ssl=True)


The source argument for Elasticsearch also supports multiple servers, though
this requires that you manually specify the 'elastic' source_type:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> corpus = read_input(source=["https://server1", "https://server2"],
                            index="test_index", source_type="elastic", content_field="text")


For more information on server options, please refer to `Elasticsearch's
documentation <https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.org/en/master/>`_.

Extra keyword arguments are also passed to the scroll helper that returns
results. Of special note here, an additional ``query`` keyword argument can be
passed to limit the records imported from the server. This query must follow the
Elasticsearch query DSL. For more information on Elasticsearch query DSL, please
refer to `Elasticsearch's DSL docs
<https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> query = "{"filtered": {"query": {"match": { "tweet": "full text search"}}}}"
   >>> corpus = read_input(source="https://localhost:9200", index="test_index",
                           content_field="tweet", query=query)
