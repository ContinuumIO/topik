Installation
############


Topik is meant to be a high-level interface for many topic modeling utilities (tokenizers, algorithms,
visualizations...), which can be written in different languages (Python, R, Java...). Therefore, the recommended
and easiest way to install `Topik` with all its features is using the package manager `conda`.
`Conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`_ is a cross-platform, language agnostic tool for managing packages and
environments.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install -c memex topik


There is also the option of just installing the Python features with pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install topik
