# Topik

A Topic Modeling toolbox.


## Introduction

The aim of `topik` is to provide a full suite and high-level interface for anyone interested in applying topic modeling.
For that purpose, `topik` includes many utilities beyond statistical modeling algorithms and wraps all of its
features into an easy callable function and a command line interface.

`Topik` is built on top of existing natural language and topic modeling libraries and primarily provides a wrapper around them, for a quick and easy exploratory analysis of your text data sets.

Please see our [complete documentation at ReadTheDocs](http://topik.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
