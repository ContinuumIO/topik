The nanotubes have a length of 10 \u03bcm, outer-diameter of 200 nm and inner-diameter of 100 nm. Electrochemical analyses demonstrate that the V2O5 nanotube array delivers a high initial capacity of 300 mAh/g, about twice that of the electrochemically-prepared V2O5 film. Although the V2O5 nanotube array shows a more drastic degradation than the film under electrochemical redox cycles, the nanotube array reaches a stabilized capacity of 160 mAh/g which remains about 1.3 times the stabilized capacity of the film.", "title": "Growth and Electrochemical Properties of V2O5 Nanotube Arrays", "year": "1951", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082550%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119505.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Ying Wang", " Katsunori Takahashi", " Huamei Shang", " Kyoungho Lee", "Guozhong Cao"]}
