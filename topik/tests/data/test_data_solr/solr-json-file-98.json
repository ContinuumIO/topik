According to fringe contrast analysis, this defect can be modelled by a plane of Ga atoms within the Si lattice. This plane forms during crystal growth due to local preferential incorporation of Ga atoms at crystallographically defined sites, that occur repetitively in the trains of monomolecular growth steps at the liquid/solid growth interface.", "title": "Identification of Growth Induced Planar Defects in Silicon", "year": "2015", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8142958%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400446774.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["H.
