A method is given for the simple determination of the direction and distribution of needle precipitates and the habit plane of plate precipitates based on the use of symmetry properties of the matrix crystal. The bicrystal symmetry of different orientation relationships between cubic crystals and its connection with observed and equilibrium shapes is illustrated with examples of high resolution micrographs of Ge precipitates in an Al matrix.", "title": "The Use of Symmetry in the TEM Analysts of Precipitate Morphologies", "year": "2014", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143033%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447020.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["U.
