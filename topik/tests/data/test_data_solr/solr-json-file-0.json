Hence, in this work we present the synthesis of Ta2O5 nanorods by sol gel method using DNA as structure directing agent, the size of the nanorods was of the order of 40 to 100 nm in diameter and several microns in length; this easy method can be useful in the preparation of nanomaterials for electronics, biomedical applications as well as catalysts.", "title": "Sol Gel Preparation of Ta2O5 Nanorods Using DNA as Structure Directing Agent", "year": "1917", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081671%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119281.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Humberto A.
