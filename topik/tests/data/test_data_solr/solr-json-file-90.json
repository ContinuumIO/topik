This investigation demostrates how a combination of transmission electron microscopy techniques; namely, high-resolution electron microscopy, image simulation, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and convergent-beam electron diffraction are used to characterize the atomic structures, chemistry and growth mechanisms of \u03b3' precipitate plates in an Al-4.2 a/o Ag alloy aged for 30 min. at 350\u00b0C. The complimentary information obtained from each of these techniques allows modelling of the growth process at the atomic level, thus providing insight into the basic precipitation behavior of alloys.", "title": "TEM Studies of Precipitate Growth at the Atomic Level", "year": "2007", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143039%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447044.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["J.
