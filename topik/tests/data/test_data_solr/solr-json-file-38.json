Water has been shown to induce a structural transformation in nanoparticles prepared this way, which is not related to their particle size. Employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray powder diffraction, we show here the importance of S-H interaction in the buildup to the final ZnS structure of these nanoparticles. These particles hold promise as water sensors.", "title": "Improved Crystallinity of Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles in Aqueous Environment", "year": "1955", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081474%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119244.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Navendu Goswami", "P.
