Hierarchical biological structures indigenous to the cellulose precursor were completely replicated after the reaction. Cubic phase MC composites show relative low oxygen content 0.24 wt% and a high lattice parameter of 4.327\u00c5 in TiC. The particle sizes of the MC composites are 200-700nm for SiC and 10-50nm for TiC, and high BET surface area, up to 150m2/g.", "title": "Synthesis of Metal Carbides Using Biological Templates", "year": "1920", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081177%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119189.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Yongsoon Shin", " Xiaohong S.
