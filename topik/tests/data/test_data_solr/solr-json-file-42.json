This evaluation method is applied to micro-sized cylindrical SU-8 specimens on Si substrate. The maximum shear stress between SU-8 and Si was analyzed with FEM. Fracture load required to delaminate the two materials was examined using a mechanical testing machine for micro-sized materials, which have been developed in our group. The delamination strength was determined from the maximum shear stress and the fracture load.", "title": "Development of Evaluation Method for Delamination Strength Between Micro-Sized Materials in MEMS Devices", "year": "1959", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161828%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058000.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Chiemi Ishiyama", " Junichi Hata", " Satoru Koyama", " Masato Sone", "Yakichi Higo"]}
