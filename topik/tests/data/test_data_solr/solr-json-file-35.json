The average diameter is in the range of 50 \u223c 100 nm. They consist of defect-free single-crystalline cubic structure with the [111] growth direction. The thickness of amorphous oxide outer layers was controllable by growth conditions or surface treatment. In order to protect the oxidation, the Si nanowires were coated with boron nitride layer by the reaction of boron oxide mixture with NH3.", "title": "Synthesis of Silicon Nanowires and their Heterostructures by Thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition", "year": "1952", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082342%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS194642740011944X.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Woo-Sung Jang", " Seung Yong Bae", "Jeunghee Park"]}
