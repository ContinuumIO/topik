Bubbles, which are automatically generated when water is mixed with ethanol by a simple shaking, act as a nanoreactor to produce these nanostructures. Fe containing nanowire, nanorod and nanocircle are successfully prepared by using this method. Autogenerated bubble-mediated formation of nanostructures has advantages over conventional methods in terms of short reaction time, low energy consumption and absence of complicated experimental equipments.", "title": "Autogenerated Air Bubbles for the Spontaneous Formation of Nanostructures", "year": "1931", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082045%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119372.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Seok Min Yoon", "Hee Cheul Choi"]}
