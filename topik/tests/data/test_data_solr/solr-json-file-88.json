Moire-like patterns observed in this phase were confirmed to be interference fringes due to the first and the second order diffraction beams from the incommensurate structure and were not due to the dark field diffraction contrast of domains of the commensurate structure as interpreted earlier. Lattice fringes (\u223c9\u00c5) of this modulated phase do not show any discontinuity across the boundaries of regions of different contrasts of the moire-like fringes which is expected from domain boundaries. Instead, a periodic change in the spacing of the lattice fringes (phase slip region) expected from the superposition of split superlattice spots in forming the lattice image is observed. This is the first direct observation of the existence of the phase slip region which is also expected from the discommensuration theory.", "title": "High Resolution Electron Microscopy of Triply Incommensurate Phase of 2H-TaSe2", "year": "2005", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143075%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447160.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["Takashi Onozuka*", " Nobuo Otsuka", "Hiroshi Sato"]}
