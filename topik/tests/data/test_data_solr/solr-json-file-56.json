The parameters investigated were the helical pitch angle, the cross-section radius, and the coil spacing.  The elastic modulus was found to depend most strongly on the helical pitch angle (changing by a factor of 1.3 as the pitch angle went from 35\u00b0 to 70\u00b0).  Variations in the coil radius and the film thickness had a minor effect on the modulus.  It was also found that using a finite size model (as opposed to an infinite model using periodic boundary conditions) produced better conditioned results.  A preliminary confirmation of the model's validity was performed by comparison to nanoindentation results of a nickel helically perforated thin film.", "title": "Helically Perforated Thin Films -- Dependence of Mechanical Properties on Microstructure", "year": "1973", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161902%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058255.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Sumudu P.
