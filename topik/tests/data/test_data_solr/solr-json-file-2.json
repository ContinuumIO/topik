TGA analyses showed that the precursors are highly volatile, making them suitable for AACVD studies. As deposited NiS films were polycrystalline as confirmed by XRD. The films have been characterised by xray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Energy dispersive analysis of x-rays (EDAX).", "title": "The Use of Xanthates as Precursors for the Deposition of Nickel Sulfide Thin Films by Aerosol Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition", "year": "1919", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082446%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119475.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["P.L.
