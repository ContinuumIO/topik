Solute segregation under equilibrium or nonequilibrium conditions can strongly influence material performance. X-ray microanalysis in an analytical electron microscope provides an alternative technique to measure grain boundary segregation, as well as segregation to other defects not accessible to Auger analysis. The utility of the technique is demonstrated by measurements of equilibrium segregation to boundaries in an antimony containing stainless steel, including the variation of segregation with boundary character and by measurements of nonequilibrium segregation to boundaries and dislocations in an ionirradiated stainless steel.", "title": "Measurement of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Segregation by X-Ray Microanalysis", "year": "2016", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143030%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447019.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["Edward A.
