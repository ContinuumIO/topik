We show one of examples to study of MgO(111) surface analysis. A visual image of Mg atoms due to the projected blocking pattern represents the crystalline structure of the MgO(111) surfaces. This figure shows the trajectory of scattered 4He0 particles due to Mg atoms along low-index lattice planes and crystallographic directions. Insulator surface structural analysis becomes more important in materials sciences.", "title": "Low Energy Atom Scattering Spectroscopy for Insulator Surface Analysis: MgO(111) Surfaces", "year": "2004", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8825209%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427413000833.html", "vol": "1531", "authors": ["K.
