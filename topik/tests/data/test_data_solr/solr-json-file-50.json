The nonlinear feature arises from the unique layered, porous and cracked morphology of thermal sprayed ceramic materials. With this procedure, various specimens were tested to investigate the effects of processing condition. The measured nonlinear properties are interpreted in the context of microstructural changes in the plasma sprayed coatings due to differences in particle state upon impact and coating build-up. The implications of this study are significant for thermo-mechanical design of strain-tolerant ceramic coatings in thermal barrier applications.", "title": "Optimizing Nonlinear Properties of Thermal Sprayed Coatings through Processing Parameters", "year": "1967", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161908%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058279.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Yajie Liu", " Toshio Nakamura", " Vasudevan Srinivasan", " Andrew Gouldstone", "Sanjay Sampath"]}
