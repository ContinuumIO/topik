The time-scale of these impact event falls between typical scratch tests (less than 1m/s) and ballistic tests (100s of m/s) and has not been studied in depth to date. Polymeric lens materials like polycarbonate are usually treated with a scratch-resistant coating, which is commonly silica-based. The coating provides some protection, yet is not sufficient at resisting abrasion from blown sand in most commercial products. We demonstrate that silicone elastomeric coatings are superior to polycarbonate and silica glass at resisting damage by blown sand particles. Sand abrasion tests were conducted using a custom-built test apparatus that exposes the sample to 400 micron diameter quartz silica moving at 16.5 m/s (approx. 38 mph). Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of small cracks and pits in polycarbonate, coated polycarbonate, and silica glass after sand exposure. No such damage was observed in the silicone-coated samples after an identical exposure.", "title": "Optical Coating Properties for Enhanced Blown-Sand Abrasion Resistance", "year": "1971", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161821%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057973.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Christopher Drew", " Suzanne Bosselman", "David Ziegler"]}
