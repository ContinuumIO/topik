In-situ tensile tests under neutron beam were performed on a Cu/Nb nanocomposite composed of a multiscale Cu matrix embedding 554 Nb filaments with a diameter of 267 nm and spacing of 45 nm. The evolution of elastic strains for individual lattice plane in each phase and peak profiles in the copper matrix versus applied stress evidenced the co-deformation behavior with different elastic-plastic regimes and load sharing: the Cu matrix exhibits size effect in the finest channels while the Nb nanowhiskers remain elastic up to the macroscopic failure, with a strong load transfer from the copper matrix onto zones that are still in the elastic regime. Taking into account results from residual lattice strains also determined by neutron diffraction, the yield stress in the finest Cu channels is in agreement with calculations based on a single dislocation regime.", "title": "Size Effect in the Plasticity of Multiscale Nanofilamentary Cu/Nb Composite Wires During in-situ Tensile Tests Under Neutron Beam", "year": "1968", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161851%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058085.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Vanessa Vidal", " Ludovic Thilly", " Steven Van Petegem", " Uwe Stuhr", " Florence Lecouturier", " Pierre-Olivier Renault", "Helena Van Swygenhoven"]}
