Previously, nanoindentation of bulk InGaAs at 300K gave a yield pressure of 6GPa (Jayawera et al Proc. Roy Soc, A459, 2049, 2003) while bending at 500 centigrade gave a yield value of 30MPa (Pp\u2019 ng et al Phil. Mag. 85, 4429, 2005). In contrast, coherently strained InGaAs superlattices gave nanoindentation values of 3GPa at room temperature and bending at 500oC gave a yield value also around 3GPa. It appears that the coherency strain can impart an athermal strengthening to the superlattice. It is clearly necessary to do mechanical testing over the range 300-800K that will be able to link the room temperature nanoindentation with the results from the high temperature bending experiment and to determine the relationship between strength, coherency strain and temperature. Preliminary experiments on these samples at elevated temperatures using a hot stage and the UMIS nanoindentation system is difficult but feasible with the help of AFM to verify the contact area.", "title": "Strength of Coherently Strained Nanolayers Under High Temperature Nanoindentation", "year": "1992", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161845%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058061.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Mok Yew P'ng", " X.
