The polymer and the plastic materials used as flexible substrates are more bendable and lighter weight compared to glass substrates. However, its mechanical and surface properties differed from glass substrates result in different quality of TCO layers deposited on it. In this study, Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and glass were used as substrates. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Zinc Oxide (ZnO), Mg-doped ZnO (MZO), Al-doped ZnO (AZO), Ga-doped ZnO (GZO), Al-doped MZO (AMZO), Ga-doped MZO (GMZO) were used as TCO materials deposited by RF sputtering. Rutherford Backscatter Spectroscopy (RBS) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze the chemical composition and crystal structure of TCO thin films. Light transmittance and surface resistivity were measured after the different deposited conditions. , Mg-, Al-, Ga- doped ZnO indeed modified the optical properties of ZnO and better than ITO. However, the electrical conductivity was not improved obviously compared to ITO when they deposited on PET substrate at room temperature.", "title": "Properties of Transparent Conductive Oxide Films on Flexible Substrates", "year": "1982", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161815%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS194642740005795X.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Shih Hsiu Hsiao", " Yoshikazu Tanaka", "Ari Ide-Ektessabi"]}
