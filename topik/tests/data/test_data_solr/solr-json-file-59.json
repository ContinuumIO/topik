The copolymer of formaldehyde and dioxolane (CFD) and the polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) are chosen as polymeric matrixes. A comparative analysis of the tribological properties of composite materials with fine nanosized fillers (5-10 nm) and nanosized analogues (100-200) is made. It is determined that the use of nanosized isotropic structure Mo fillers leads to improved wear-resistance up to three times for CFD-based composites and up to four times for PPS-based. The highest hardness values were observed while using isotropic nanosized tungsten fillers. The nanosized crystalline fillers also give positive results, but the bigger sized fillers decrease the polymer hardness characteristics comparatively nanosize isotropic analogues.", "title": "The Influence of Nanosized Molybdenum and Tungsten Fillers on the Physico-Mechanical and Tribological Properties of Polymer-based Composite Materials", "year": "1976", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161878%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058176.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Victor Makaryan"]}
