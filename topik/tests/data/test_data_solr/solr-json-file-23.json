The diameter is periodically modulated in the range of 50-90 nm. They consist of one In-O layer and five (or six) layered Zn-O slabs stacked alternately perpendicular to the long axis, with a modulation period of 1.65 (or 1.9) nm. These superlattice nanowires were doped with 6-8 % Sn. X-ray diffraction pattern reveals the structural defects of wurtzite ZnO crystals due to the In/Sn incorporation. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrum suggests that In/Sn withdraw the electrons from Zn, and enhance the number of dangling-bond O 2p states, resulting in the reduction of band gap. Photoluminescence exhibit the peak shift of near band edge emission to the lower energy as the In/Sn content increases.", "title": "Short-Period Superlattice Structure of Sn-doped In2O3(ZnO)4 and In2O3(ZnO)5 Nanowires", "year": "1940", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082381%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119451.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Chan Woong Na", " Seung Yong Bae", "Jeunghee Park"]}
