The effects of contact transfer films, grain-shape sizes and distributions, grain-boundary structure and sliding, texture, and strength are used to determine the optimal thin film coating compositions.  Comparisons are made with experimental measurements and observations, and guidelines for optimal thin film composite coatings are proposed.", "title": "Computational Modeling and Design of Adaptive Thin-Film Composite Coatings", "year": "1988", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161863%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058127.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["James Deon Pearson", " Mohammed A.
