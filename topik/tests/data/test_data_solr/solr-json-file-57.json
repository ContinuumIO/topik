Going beyond previous results, the analytical model takes into account the mechanics of multilayers and elastic supports covering all cases between rigidly clamped to simply supported structures and enables the straightforward assessment of stress profiles within the deformed structures. A comprehensive set of long membranes made of various multilayers of silicon nitride and oxide films are fabricated and characterized. The out-of-plane deflection profile under pressure load is monitored by means of a laser profilometer. The pressure is stepped up until fracture occurs. From the stress profiles in the membrane at fracture, the brittle material strength is analyzed using Weibull statistics. The bulge setup has been fully automated for the measurement of 80 membranes per wafer. This realizes, for the first time, the high throughput-acquisition of mechanical thin film data with convincing statistical control.", "title": "Mechanical Characterization of Thin-Film Composites using the Load-Deflection Response of Multilayer Membranes - Elastic and Fracture Properties", "year": "1974", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161860%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058115.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Joao Gaspar", " Patrick Ruther", "Oliver Paul"]}
