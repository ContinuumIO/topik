Flexural stiffness domains governed by flexural modulus, density, and layer geometry have been visualized on efficiency maps. It is demonstrated that although a bi-material system can evolve in several symmetric and asymmetric multilayers, the flexural properties of all the possible configurations fall into a region. This is bounded by two curves describing three symmetric layers sandwiches.", "title": "Flexural Stiffness Domains for Bi-material Multilayered Systems [Abstract + Supplemental Data]", "year": "2001", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161884%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS194642740005819X.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Damiano Pasini"]}
