W powders and gas-atomized 2024 Al aluminum powder were milled by ball milling with different milling parameters. The mixtures were consolidated by vacuum hot press under a pressure of 400MPa and then hot-extruded for a higher density. A T6 heat treatment was carried out for the samples, which consisted of solution treating at temperature 470-500, water quenching and artificial aging at 1900 for 8h. The microstructure of as-milled mixture powders and the composites were investigated by combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The microstructure and its relationship with the mechanical properties of the composites were also investigated. The results show the milling-energy is a key factor for the processing of the composite. For the samples with high energy milling, Al atoms dissolved into W lattice gradually and finally formed a W solution after 6 hours milling, which can cause the a large amount of precipitation of WAl12, WAl5 in the following hot pressing process. With appropriate processing parameters, the tensile strength of the composite can reach 480 MPa.", "title": "Precessing of 2024 Al /W Composites Prepared by Powder Metallurgy", "year": "1996", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161800%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057894.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Zhimin Yang", " Jian Yang", " Youyun Lian", "Changhui Mao"]}
