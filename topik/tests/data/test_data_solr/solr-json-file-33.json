[Cd(S2CNHC12H25)2] complex was used as a single source precursor to synthesize CdS nanoparticles. Synthesis of CdS nanoparticles was carried out at various thermolysis temperatures and concentration of the precursor to observe the morphological changes. At moderate or high temperature the 1D nanostructures (single-rods, bend rods or multi-rods) are generated. The shape of CdS nanocrystals varied from longer rods to shorter rods with increased width (average size: 4nm wide and 27nm long vs. 9nm wide and 27nm long) by simply increasing the quantity of precursor in the bulk solution from 0.05g/8ml HDA to 1g/8ml HDA at 250\u00b0C.", "title": "N-alkyldithiocarbamato complexes [Cd(S2CNHR)2] (R = C2H5, C4H9, C6H13, C12H25); Synthesis, Characterisation and Deposition of II/VI Nanoparticles.", "year": "1950", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082405%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119463.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["A.
