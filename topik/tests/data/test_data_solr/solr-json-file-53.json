The finite element implementation of our model considers a three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE), and incorporates continuum-based physics-inspired descriptions of shear yielding and crazing, along with failure criteria for the ductile and brittle layers. The interface between the ductile and brittle layers is assumed to be perfectly bonded. The model successfully explains the volume fraction effect on the micro and macromechanics of ductile/brittle microlaminates subjected to uniaxial tension.", "title": "Modeling Ductile/Brittle Behavior in Polymeric Microlaminates: Effect of Volume Fraction", "year": "1970", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161872%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058152.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Rajdeep Sharma", " Mary C.
