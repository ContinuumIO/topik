The experimental results revealed that ND composite platings  had the remarkable differences such as surface roughness, morphology and friction coefficient compared to conventional diamond-free electroless Ni-P plating.The best mechanical properties were obtained when the concentration of  ND powder  was 1g/l and the ultrasonic treatment  time was 30min and pH of the plating solution was 5.From these results, we were confirmed  that the ND particles were uniformly co-deposited in the Ni-matrix when electroless Ni-P/ND composite plating was deposited by the best  plating  conditions.", "title": "Mechanical Properties of Ni-P/Diamond Composite Films Processed by Electro-less Plating Method", "year": "1966", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161805%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057912.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Jin Ki Cho", " Mi Sun Yoo", " Moon Tea Kim", " Seung Roung Beak", " Sung Goon Kang", "Chan Hyoung Kang"]}
