XRD measurements prove the presence of cubic BaTiO3 with traces of BaCO3 as side product. According to TEM investigations, the particles exhibit a nearly spherical particle shape with diameters ranging from 10 to 15 nm. However, due to the lack of any stabilizers, the particles are slightly agglomerated. NMR analysis of the obtained reaction solution shows that aldol condensation reactions of acetophenone and in situ formed acetone provide the water necessary for inducing crystallization and nanoparticle formation.", "title": "Nonaqueous Synthesis of Barium Titanate Nanocrystals in Acetophenone as Oxygen Supplying Agent", "year": "1927", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082662%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119530.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Markus Niederberger", "Georg Garnweitner"]}
