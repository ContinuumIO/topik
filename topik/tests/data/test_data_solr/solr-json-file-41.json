A solvent based method was used to deposit trichlorosilane on E-glass fiber surfaces followed by in situ modification of the deposited layer to prepare pure and mixed amine undecyl self assembled monolayer (SAM).  The extent of fiber/matrix adhesion was determined by performing single fiber fragmentation test (SFFT).  The SFFT data indicate that \u2248 85 % of fiber breaks obtained for epoxy composite occurs at a much lower mass fraction of amine coverage for SAM while a similar number of fiber breaks occur at a much higher mass fraction of amine coverage for aqueous solution deposited coupling agent system.", "title": "An Investigation of the Influence of Interface Chemical Structure on Fiber/Matrix Adhesion", "year": "1958", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161875%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058164.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Dharmaraj Raghavan"]}
