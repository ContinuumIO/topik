The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that the nanocrystals fabricated by the different methods are under optimized growth conditions single crystals of zincblende structure and of regular spherical shape. The average size was estimated to be between 2.0-3.0 nm with a size dispersion that depends on the synthesis route and is in the range between 10% and 20%. The XPS results indicate that for the nanoparticles obtained via solventless strategy the sulfur is present both as bonded to the metal atom and to the organic residue, while in the TOPO synthesized nanoparticles the sulfur signal has only one component associated to the metal-sulfide bond. The photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) analysis of CdS crystals clearly evidences the typical emissions of nanosized zincblende CdS monocrystalline particles. Furthermore, the optical spectroscopy data indicate that the size distribution of the Cdsulfide - TOPO nanoparticles seems to be generally larger than that ones grown directly in polymer matrix. For all the CdS samples, the metal-sulfide nanocrystals exhibit a trap-related radiative transition at about 2eV that can be attributed to the hole-electron recombination at particle surface defect-center."}

Using nanosphere lithography, patterned nanowires were obtained and their growth positions were controlled by the locations of Au catalysts. For the second method, without silicon monoxide as the precursor and without the aid of Au catalyst, silicon oxide nanowires directly formed along the <110> direction of the silicon substrate only with the introduction of hydrogen gas. A series of experiments were carried out to study effects of reaction time, temperature, and hydrogen on the growth of the nanowires. Also, various electron microscopy techniques were utilized to characterize their morphologies and internal structures and to analyze their compositional distributions. In this paper, the characterization of different silicon oxide nanowires and their formation mechanisms in relation to both preparation methods are discussed."}

{"doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICICIP.2011.6008251","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is an extremely important aspect of modern technological progress. It represents humanity's long-time dream of elevating computers beyond the realm of simple machines for the calculation and processing of data. With the incorporation of artificial intelligence, computers are able to engage in behavior similar to human thought, helping humans perform necessary tasks of cognition, theorizing, and even judgment. Genetic algorithms (GA) are a branch of artificial intelligence and have been demonstrated to be fast and accurate in the pursuit of efficiency and accuracy. GA is often applied to optimization problems for single and multiple targets. Progress in computer hardware and software programming language has driven the development of artificial intelligence. All applications or research relevant to artificial intelligence algorithms require computer programs that meet individual constraints and individual objectives; in other words, each different problem has its own specialized computer program. Though software suites based on GA already exist (e.g., Evolver, SUGAL), these have limitations in practical usage and may be unable to fully realize the effectiveness of GA. As such, this study utilizes Microsoft Visual Basic to develop an open source standard module system based on GA, allowing users to create programs which meet problem constraints within a short period of time. When standard program modules are unable to meet these requirements, users can also customize the original source code according to particular demands. Research results demonstrate that standard module systems built on GA can help users to complete computer programs within a short period of time, and also increase the accuracy of programs. This study has already developed around 30 standard program modules. Testing has already been completed for all program modules, and the open source code for all program modules has been placed on the http://cost.ce.cyut.edu.tw/lab websi- - te for download."}

The first Knowledge Discovery in Databases Workshop was held in August 1989, in conjunction with the 1989 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, and this workshop series became the International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) in 1995. In 2003, there were a total of 15 data mining conferences, most of which are listed at http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/meetings-2OO3-past.html. These 15 conferences do not include various artificial intelligence (AI), statistics and database conferences (and their workshops) that also solicited and accepted data mining related papers, such as DC AI, ICML, ICTAI, COMPSTAT, AI & Statistics, SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, and CIKM. Among various data mining conferences, KDD and ICDM (the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining) are arguably (or unarguably) the two premier ones in the field. ICDM was established in 2000, sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society, and had its first annual meeting in 2001. This work reviews the topics of interest from ICDM from an AI perspective, and analyze common topics in data mining and AI, including key AI ideas that have been used in both data mining and machine learning. We also discuss two current research projects on (1) user-centered agents for biological information exploration on the Web, and (2) dynamic classifier selection in dealing with streaming data.

Thus, graph theory is used to describe in a formal and concise way the switching mechanism between the various plant parameterizations of the switched system. Moreover, the interpretation of multimodel controllers in an artificial intelligence frame allows the application of each specific technique to the design of improved multimodel based controllers. The obtained artificial intelligence-based multimodel controllers are compared with classical single model based ones. It is shown through simulation examples that a transient response improvement can be achieved by using multiestimation based techniques. Furthermore, a method for synthesizing multimodel based neural network controllers from already designed single model based ones is presented, extending the applicability of this kind of techniques to a more general type of controllers. Also, some applications of genetic algorithms to multimodel controller design are proposed"}

Therefore, he discusses a specific model-based approach to the study of these early stages. Research in artificial intelligence-including investigations into diagnosis and situation assessment, analogical reasoning, plan recognition, nonmonotonic reasoning and distributed intelligence, among others-can be used to build models of strategic decision making that help researchers in better understanding this traditionally unstructured activity"}

The purpose is to help designers to choose design parameters according to technical specifications and customers needs. Because of the high number of parameters and possible combinations, a heuristic based approach is investigated for optimization activity when the task is a multiple objective combinatorial one and when the criteria to be optimized cannot be weighted or ordered. A Hybrid Search (HS) algorithm based on some metaheuristic mechanisms is proposed for optimization without resuming the multiple objectives to a single one. The specified algorithm derives the best (not dominated) solution set: the Pareto front, from the set of acceptable solutions defined by the design parameters, and is quite faster compared to exhaustive methods. Self-organizing Maps are then used to analyze the obtained fronts. Our approach is fully illustrated in the case of the design of a 2-Degrees Of Freedom robot."}

However, working definitions of moral injury have not yet fully clarified the mechanisms whereby violations of conscience result in these outcomes or their co-occurrence with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, advances from the field of moral psychology are used to integrate cognitive, affective, and social dimensions of the emerging moral injury construct, while also pointing to new possibilities for clinical intervention. After reviewing the salience of moral injury for military and veteran populations, the presence of negative moral emotions (e.g., guilt, anger, disgust) are examined within the context of trauma and military-related PTSD. Next, social functionalist accounts of moral emotions are used to explain the development of moral injury and are linked to potential etiologies of PTSD that emphasize both fear and nonfear emotions. Finally, the clinical importance of positive moral emotions for existing and emerging trauma-focused interventions is discussed. Future directions for research and clinical interventions are identified highlighting the importance of utilizing community support"}
{"doi":"http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/cep0000042","abstract":"Skilled hand use is a striking feature of human behaviour, but in contrast to the view that it recently evolved in the primate lineage, the present paper argues that skilled hand movements have an early phylogenetic origin dating back to the synergies displayed by the pectoral fins of bony fishes. Insights into the function and evolution of hand use stem from the dual visuomotor channel theory, which proposes that prehension is a composite of 2 movements, the reach and the grasp. The reach is in part an egocentric act directed toward the extrinsic (location) features of objects while the grasp is in part an allocentric act directed toward the intrinsic (shape and size) features of objects. Phylogenetic, developmental, and behavioural evidence suggest that the reach and the grasp evolved separately under somatosensory control and were subsequently coordinated with visual control in the primate lineage. Accordingly, parallel pathways from visual cortex came to influence separate reach and grasp systems in parietofrontal cortex, and new descending pathways to the spinal cord came to assist in visually guided reaching. Neural processes related to the “where” of the reach and the “what” of the grasp have had a formative role in shaping cognition more generally. "}

Focusing on 257 teachers from educational departments throughout El Salvador, we incorporated structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine (1) whether exposure to MIEs for this population (e.g., betrayal, witnessing harm to an innocent student) are directly linked with higher PTSD symptomatology and work-related burnout and (2) whether MIEs contribute to these outcomes via meaning made of trauma. SEM results revealed that MIEs were in fact uniquely linked with PTSD symptoms and burnout, above and beyond rates of direct victimization and demographic factors. In addition, greater MIEs were indirectly linked with study outcomes via the extent to which teachers were able to make meaning of their identified stressors. These findings support the importance of screening for MIEs among helping professionals and also suggest that meaning making could serve as a central mediating factor for how MIEs contribute to trauma-related problems among persons working to promote peace and justice in the world."}

Based on the extensive literature on stereotype threat, we hypothesized that activating negative metastereotypes would undermine employability beliefs of members of disadvantaged groups, because such beliefs are likely to threaten their state self-esteem. In particular, we expected that an effect of negative metastereotyping on employability beliefs would be explained by momentary self-doubts and be particularly evident among members whose dispositional self-esteem is high rather than low to begin with.

{"doi":"http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/xan0000051","abstract":"Three experiments examined the role of context in punishment learning. In Experiment 1, rats were trained to lever press for food in Context A and then punished for responding in Context B (by presenting response-contingent footshock). Punishment led to complete suppression of the response. However, when responding was tested (in extinction) in Contexts A and B, a strong renewal of responding occurred in Context A. In Experiment 2, renewal also occurred when initial reinforcement occurred in Context A, punishment occurred in Context B, and testing occurred in a new context (Context C). In both experiments, behavioral suppression and renewal were not observed in groups that received noncontingent (yoked) footshocks in Context B. In Experiment 3, 2 responses (lever press and chain pull) were separately reinforced in Contexts A and B and then punished in the opposite context. Although the procedure equated the contexts on their association with reinforcement and punishment, renewal of each response was observed when it was tested in its nonpunished context. The contexts also influenced response choice. Overall, the results suggest that punishment is specific to the context in which it is learned, and establish that its context-specificity does not depend on a simple association between the context and shock. Like extinction, punishment may involve learning to inhibit a specific response in a specific context. Implications for theories of punishment and for understanding the cessation of problematic operant behavior (e.g., drug abuse) are discussed."}

To selectively enhance the difficulty associated with processing each of these aspects, on a large number of comparison trials, either the comparative instruction or the stimulus pair, respectively, was presented only very briefly. Results indicate that memory for the comparative instructions was dependent on the relative size of the stimulus pair such that participants were more likely to correctly identify the smaller form of the comparative instruction after comparing pairs of small stimulus items, as well as more likely to correctly identify the larger form of the comparative instruction after comparing pairs of large stimulus items.

For counterstereotypic pairings (armed Whites, unarmed Blacks), participants acquired information more slowly. In Study 2, eye tracking showed that participants relied on more ambiguous information (measured by visual angle from fovea) when responding to stereotypic targets; for counterstereotypic targets, they achieved greater clarity before responding. In Study 3, participants were briefly exposed to targets (limiting access to visual information) but had unlimited time to respond. In spite of their slow, deliberative responses, they showed racial bias. This pattern is inconsistent with control failure and suggests that stereotypes influenced identification of the object.

The sample consisted of 239 veterans of different service eras and their intimate partners. Veterans and partners reported their physical and psychological IPA perpetration and victimization over the past 6 months. Methodological improvements over prior concordance studies included the use of clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms and the assessment of relationship attributions via observational coding of couples’ conflict interactions. Results suggested low to moderate levels of agreement between veterans and partners and indicated that relationship satisfaction was associated with reporting less IPA than one’s partner reported, replicating prior concordance findings. Previous concordance findings with self-reported PTSD symptoms were also reproduced in the current study using clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. Veterans’ PTSD symptoms were associated with reporting less IPA than their partners reported and partners’ PTSD symptoms were associated with reporting more IPA than the veterans reported. Additionally, we found an association between relationship attributions and reporting discrepancies. For both dyad members, making more positive and less negative relationship attributions was associated with reporting less IPA than one’s partner reported. Findings underscore the difficulty of obtaining objective self-reports of adverse behavior and highlight factors that may influence such reports. Clinically, this information could be used to better identify cases in which obtaining collateral reports of IPA are particularly warranted."}
