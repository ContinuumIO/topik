The films are polycrystalline, and the plasmon energy increases considerably with increasing carbon content. Combination of the information obtained from electron energy loss plasmon and core loss spectra, and electron diffraction indicates that x in TiCx increases linearly with methane partial pressure. We find that the face centered cubic TIC phase spans the composition from TiC0.2 to TiC1.0 and when x<l we have a mixture of TiC1.0 and amorphous C.", "title": "Characterization of Reactively Sputtered Titanium Carbide Films by Analytical Electron Microscopy", "year": "2013", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143096%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447238.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["J.
