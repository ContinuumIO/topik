Nylon 6 and poly(ethylene terephthalate) have been used as the matrix polymer and aluminum borate whisker and carbon nanotube have been used as the fillers. The wear resistance of the fibers has been evaluated by observing the fiber cross section after the side of the fiber was worn using a rotating drum covered with abrasive paper. The wear resistance of the nylon 6 and PET fibers was increased by the addition of these fillers without the loss of tensile modulus and strength. The effects of the addition of the fillers on the wear resistance have been compared with the effects of stretching and heat treatment of the fibers.", "title": "Wear Resistance and Mechanical Properties of Polymeric Fibers Filled with Inorganic Fillers", "year": "1989", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161881%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058188.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Toshihira Irisawa", " Masatoshi Shioya", " Haruki Kobayashi", "Junichi Kaneko"]}
