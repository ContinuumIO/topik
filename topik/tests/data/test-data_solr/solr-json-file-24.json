The growth mechanisms of the nanostructures were proposed and discussed. Photoluminescence spectra showed a UV and green emission peaks at room temperature. Field emission measurements revealed that the turn-on field is very low and the emission current density is relative to the morphology and size. Such ZnO nanostructures are likely to be candidates as building blocks for constructing photonic and field emission crystals.", "title": "Morphology and Properties of Tetraleg ZnO Nanostructures Fabricated by Zn-Powder Evaporation without Catalysts at Lower Temperature", "year": "1941", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082506%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119499.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Yue Zhang", " Yunhua Huang", " Jian He", " Ying Dai", " Sen Wang", "Cheng Zhou"]}
