In order to utilize effectively these materials for M/NEMS applications, understanding of their microscopic structure and physical (mechanical properties, in particular) become indispensable. The micro- and nanocrystalline diamond films were grown using hot-filament and microwave chemical vapor deposition techniques involving novel CH4 / [TMB for boron doping and H2S for sulfur incorporation] in high hydrogen dilution chemistry.  To investigate residual stress distribution and intermolecular forces at nanoscale, the films were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in terms of topography, force curves and force volume imaging. Traditional force curve measures the force felt by the tip as it approaches and retracts from a point on the sample surface, while force volume is an array of force curves over an extended range of sample area. Moreover, detailed microscale structural studies are able to demonstrate that the carbon bonding configuration (sp2 versus sp3 hybridization) and surface chemical termination in both the un-doped and doped diamond have a strong effect on nanoscale intermolecular forces. The preliminary information in the force volume measurement was decoupled from topographic data to offer new insights into the materials's", "title": "Residual Stress Distribution, Intermolecular Force, And Frictional Coefficient Maps In Diamond Films: Processing-Structure-Mechanical Property Relationship", "year": "1978", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161810%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057936.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Sanju Gupta", " Oliver Williams", " R.
