Literature on electrical resistivity studies of age-hardening superalloys is limited. The current work is focused on developing microstructure-electrical resistivity correlations in controlled Waspaloy microstructures. The microstructures are \u2018controlled\u2019 as the size distribution of g\u00a2 precipitates is varied systematically. The microstructures are produced upon aging the initial homogenized alloy at nominal temperatures of 700\u00b0C, 800\u00b0C and 875\u00b0C for times up to 100 hrs. Resistivity measurements did not reveal a g\u00a2 nucleation regime for the sampled aging intervals. The primary microstructural evolution mechanism contributing to the observed changes in resistivity was g\u00a2 coarsening. Interestingly, the microstructures resulting from progressive aging at 700\u00b0C showed a slow transformation of etch-pits from perfect polygonal shapes to more irregular shapes.", "title": "Microstructure-Resistivity Correlations in Controlled  Waspaloy Microstructures", "year": "1980", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161802%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057900.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["V.
