In this study, we further refined this technique and applied it to low-friction and high-hardness Cu-doped MoN films. These magnetron sputtered nanocomposites films consist of MoN, Mo2N, and Cu phases, whose ratio depends on Cu concentration. By using the microdiffraction technique, we discovered that both the deviatoric and the hydrostatic components of the residual stresses depend on the film depth (Fig.1). The former indicates depth-dependent distribution of biaxial stresses, while the latter implies depth-dependent defect distribution, which also depends on Cu concentration. Thermal annealing of the nanocomposite film partially relives the stress, significantly reduces the lattice spacing, and eliminates the defect gradients. These results suggest that interstitial N may play an important role in the lattice expansion and the defect gradients formed during the non-equilibrium sputtering process. Our study provides fresh insights into understanding the structure-property relations in the magnetron sputtered MoN:Cu nanocomposites films.", "title": "Depth-dependent defect and residual stress distribution in magnetron sputtered MoN:Cu nanocomposite films by x-ray microdiffraction", "year": "1964", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161857%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058103.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Gang Chen", " Dileep Singh", " Osman Eryilmaz", " Ali Erdemir", " Jules Routbort", "Wenjun Liu"]}
