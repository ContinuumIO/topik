The bremsstrahlung count decreases much faster than that of the characteristic count with the increase of the incident beam energy. The decrease rate depends on Z number. It is ascertained that the P/B ratio and the spatial resolution at 400 keV were 2 or 3 and 2.5 times better than those at 100 keV, respectively.", "title": "Some Advantages of EDS Analysis in a 400 KV Electron Microscope", "year": "2009", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143000%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400446919.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["S.
