Ultrahigh vacuum deposition of monolayers of material, buffered and co-adsorbed along with chemically-inert working gas molecules, and subsequent pressurization in situ with high purity helium, led to self-assembly of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles in the liquid phase. The density and size distribution of nanoparticles were found to depend on processing parameters including the substrate surface condition and the dilution of the co-adsorbed film. These results are discussed in terms of surface and interface energies and kinetics.", "title": "Combined UHV and Liquid Phase (CULP) Processing of Self-assembled Nanostructures", "year": "1949", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081276%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119207.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Samil E.
