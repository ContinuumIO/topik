Due to the fine scale structures observed, a technique with high spatial resolution is required. X-ray microanalysis in the analytical electron microscope (AEM) provides a sufficiently high spatial resolution to determine the composition of the various phases occurring in this system. In this study, the isothermal section at 1000\u00b0C was evaluated in a series of alloys having nickel contents greater than 65 wt%. In Ni3Al, Fe can substitute for either Ni or Al in the ordered face-centered cubic lattice having an Ll2 structure. However, in substituting Fe for Ni one finds that the solubility limit is quickly exceeded at about 5 wt% Fe with the resultant formation of a ordered body-centered cubic (B2) phase at high temperature, which transforms martensitically upon quenching. Also, in substituting Fe for Al, the solubility limit is exceeded at about 5 wt% Fe with the formation of a disordered, face-centered cubic Ni-rich terminal solid solution. Thus, a very narrow range of alloy compositions exist where Fe can substitute for Ni and Al and preserve a single-phase L12 structure. It was found that the maximum solubility of Fe in Ni3Al at 1000\u00b0C was 17.3 wtpercnt; at 70.3 wt% Ni and 12.4 wt% Al.", "title": "AEM Microanalysis of Phase Equilibria in Ni3Al Intermetallic Alloys Containing Iron", "year": "2006", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143027%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447007.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["Bruce L.
