The presented paper shows new outstanding methods based on nanosphere lithography for controlling the mask morphology to improve fabrication of nanoscales perfectly ordered over some cm2 dots, rods and rings. An annealed mask with 30nm aperatures was used for the fabrication of ferromagnetic iron nanorings. These nanosystems are expected to find various unique applications. Our method permitted fabrication of nanostructured materials with unique morphology and properties. This field is expected to open new venues in science and technology.", "title": "Shadow Nanosphere Lithography: Simulation and Experiment", "year": "1947", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081968%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119359.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Michael Giersig"]}
