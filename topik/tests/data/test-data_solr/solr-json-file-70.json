These can be designed at both the architectural and microstructural levels. PCM cores with 95% open porosity have been constructed from perforated 6061 aluminium alloy (AA6061) sheets using a perforation-stretching method. This method places planar, periodically-perforated sheet metal in an alternating-pin jig. The pins apply force out-of-plane, plastically deforming the sheet metal into a truss-like array of struts (i.e. metal supports) and nodal peaks (i.e. strut intersections). The result is a non-uniform work-hardened profile exhibiting large deformation at the nodes and small deformation at the struts.", "title": "Preferential Site Precipitation and Subcell Stability in AA6061 Sandwich Cores", "year": "1987", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161911%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058280.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["B.
