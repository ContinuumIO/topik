We describe the mechanical properties of thin film AlxSi1-x alloys determined through indentation experiments. Combinatorial methods were used to systematically control thin film microstructure through variations in composition and growth temperature. Discrete libraries of compositionally graded films have been sputter deposited onto silicon substrates to produce two structural phase regions: amorphous Al-Si and amorphous Si plus crystalline Al. The mechanical properties of the thin films were determined by analyzing the load-displacement traces based on the Oliver-Pharr method. X-ray diffraction was used to investigate the microstructures and determine the crystallite sizes.", "title": "Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Combinatorially Prepared Thin Film Aluminum-Silicon Nanocomposites", "year": "1997", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161834%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058024.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Charles H.
