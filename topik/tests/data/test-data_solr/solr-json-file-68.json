X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Fourier Transfer Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were carried out to obtain the structural and thermal characteristics of resulting materials. The organo-modified LDHs have been used in the formulation of Nafion\u00ae nanocomposites. Nanocomposite membranes were prepared by casting of LDH/PFOSA nanoparticles dispersed in Nafion\u00ae solution. Then, modified LDH/Nafion composite membranes were evaluated for water retention capability at ambient and elevated temperature.", "title": "Synthesis and Characterization of Layered Double Hydroxides/Nafion Composites for Fuel Cell Application", "year": "1985", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161890%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058218.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Dharmaraj Raghavan", " Bolnale Abayomi", " Miriam Harewood", " Sheriff Abudu", " Elizabeth Williams", " Raymond Butcher", "Dharmaraj Raghavan"]}
