The single x-ray crystal structure of lead complex is reported. The cadmium thiosemicarbazide complex was thermolysed in hexadecylamine (HDA) at 140\u00b0C and 180\u00b0C to give CdS nanorods. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XRay diffraction (XRD) measurements show that the reaction temperature has the influence on the size and shape of the nanorods. The lead thiosemicarbazide was thermolysed in tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) at 240\u00b0C to yield hexagonally shaped nanoparticles of PbS. The XRD confirms a face centred cubic rock salt structure.", "title": "Cadmium and Lead Thiosemicarbazide Complexes: Precursors for the Synthesis of CdS Nanorods and PbS nanoparticles", "year": "1943", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082485%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119487.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["S.N.
