Their absorption spectrum give a band edge at 440 nm (band gap,3.0 eV). XRD pattern showed abroad peaks corresponding to cubic phase of GaS. TEM images confirmed the crystalline nature of particles with narrow size distribution (5.4 nm \u00b1 0.7 dia). To our knowledge this the first time that GaS nanoparticles have been prepared.", "title": "Synthesis of GaS Nanoparticles from a Single-Source Precursor [Ga(S2CNEt2)3/", "year": "1939", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082123%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119396.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Mohammad Azad Malik", " Paul O'Brien", " Sibusiso N.
