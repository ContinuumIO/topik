The upsurge of interest in nano-scale structures has prompted our study of the surface modification of nano-scale boehmite aluminas with organic acids in order to achieve dispersion of these materials in non-aqueous systems and alkaline aqueous systems.", "title": "Surface Modified Boehmite Aluminas: A Versatile Approach to Nano-scale Particle Dispersion and Nanocomposites", "year": "1932", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081529%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119256.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Steven L.
