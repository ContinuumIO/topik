For those applications where good electrical conductivity is also desired, carbon black is often used as the filler of choice.  Most reports in the literature indicate that at least 8 wt% carbon black filler is needed in order to achieve percolation. Our group recently reported that by manual mixing of ABS pellets and carbon black to create a segregated microstructure, percolation was achieved at an unprecedented low filler fraction of less than 0.01 wt% carbon black, a value which is comparable to or even better than that obtained using single wall carbon nanotubes as the filler.  While the ABS/CB composites had excellent electrical performance, with a conductivity as high as 10-1  S/m, their mechanical strength was compromised.", "title": "Optimization of the Electrical Conductivity of ABS Nanocomposites filled with Carbon Black and Carbon Nanotubes", "year": "1990", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161869%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058140.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Shantanu Talapatra", "Rosario A.
