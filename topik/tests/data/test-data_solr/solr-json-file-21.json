XRD results showed that the powders were tetragonal with crystallite sizes ranging between approximately 1-50 nm depending on the thermal treatment given to the powders. BET surface area analysis of the powders gave a specific surface area of 230 m2/g for the assynthesized powders and 19.3 m2/g for the powders treated at 1000\u00b0C. This results in equivalent powder particle diameters of 4 nm and 52 nm, respectively. Washing of the powders is a very significant step for successful post-processing of powders obtained by AOT/isooctane reverse micelles. The use of ethanol and dry ether did not remove AOT, as determined from EDS measurements. Subsequent experiments showed that a novel solvent (hydrogen peroxide) was effective in removing AOT from the powders. The reason for the effectiveness of the new solvent is its capacity to decompose the AOT into weak acids, which are easily washed away with deionized water.", "title": "Reverse Micelle Synthesis of Zirconia Powders: The Use of Hydrogen Peroxide as Washing Solvent", "year": "1938", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081224%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119190.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Harpreet Singh\u00a0", "Olivia A.
