Three indenter tips with different geometries were adopted in our experiments, enabling us to probe different regimes of plastic deformation in the PECVD SiOx thin films. A shear transformation zone (STZ) based amorphous plasticity theory is applied to depict the underlying plastic deformation mechanism.", "title": "Measurement of Stress-strain Curves of PECVD Silicon Oxide Thin Films by Means of Nanoindentation", "year": "1995", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161818%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057961.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Zhiqiang Cao", "Xin Zhang"]}
