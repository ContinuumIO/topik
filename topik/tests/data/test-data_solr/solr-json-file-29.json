Here, we have prepared Mn doped ZnO by electrodeposition. The samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods to ensure that the dopants are substitutional. Some samples exhibit weak ferromagnetic properties at room temperature, however to be useful for spintronics this material need additional carriers provided by others means.", "title": "Formation of ZnO Doped with Mn Thin Film by Electrodeposition and Magnetic Behaviour.", "year": "1946", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8082262%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119426.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["M.
