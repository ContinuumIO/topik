Ge oxidation and bonding are studied at 300-1000 K with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Ge, GeH, GeO, and GeO2 desorption are measured with temperature programmed desorption (TPD) at 400-1000 K. Ge initially reacts with the dielectric forming an oxide layer followed by Ge deposition and formation of nanocrystals in CVD at 870 K. 0.7-1.0 ML GeHx deposited by cracking rapidly forms a contacting oxide layer on HfO2 that is stable from 300-800 K. Ge is fully removed from the HfO2 surface after annealing to 1000 K. These results help explain the stability of Ge nanocrystals in contact with HfO2.", "title": "Interactions of Ge Atoms with High- \u00ea Oxide Dielectric Surfaces", "year": "1926", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081623%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS194642740011927X.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Scott K.
