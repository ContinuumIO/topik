Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a high spatial resolution (probe sizes < 100nm) analytical technique which is sensitive to variations in carbon or nitrogen stoichiometry. This sensitivity to light elements depends on the ability to relate the measured EELS spectrum to a material's electronic structure. The unique capabilities of EELS for the characterization of carbonitrides with high spatial resolution are discussed along with some of the experimental and analytical methods used to relate measured spectra to electronic structure. Data are presented for several members of the systems Ti-N-C and Cr-Fe-C.", "title": "Electron Energy Loss Fine Structure of Carbides and Nitrides", "year": "2012", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143003%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400446920.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["Mark M.
