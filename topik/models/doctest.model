These magnetron sputtered nanocomposites films consist of MoN, Mo2N, and Cu phases, whose ratio depends on Cu concentration. By using the microdiffraction technique, we discovered that both the deviatoric and the hydrostatic components of the residual stresses depend on the film depth (Fig.1). The former indicates depth-dependent distribution of biaxial stresses, while the latter implies depth-dependent defect distribution, which also depends on Cu concentration. Thermal annealing of the nanocomposite film partially relives the stress, significantly reduces the lattice spacing, and eliminates the defect gradients.

SiNWs also open the possibility for integrating optoelectronics with microelectronics, since silicon has semiconducting properties and amorphous silicon nanowires have been shown to emit blue light. It has been demonstrated that SiNWs have tunable electrical properties, depending on the dopant used. With such a range of applications, the ability to mass-produce silicon nanowires simply and easily with no other source of silicon needed other than the substrate itself will prove very useful. Such methods have previously been reported, but our method involves production of the SiNWs at a lower temperature than those widely observed. A (100) silicon substrate was cleaned for five minutes each in ethanol followed by acetone. Films with thicknesses of less than 20 nm of either gold or 60/40 gold/palladium were deposited on the substrate through physical vapor deposition to serve as the growth center for the SiNWs. The samples were placed in a furnace and annealed to 900\u00b0 C, under a 1500 sccm flow of argon at atmospheric pressure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization of the SiNWs. The resulting SiNWs were amorphous in structure and very convoluted, with lengths on the order of tens of microns, diameters of 40 nm and a bed thickness of approximately 10 m. The effect of varying gold concentration, annealing time, temperature, and gas flow rate were then investigated. The results, which will be discussed in further detail, indicate that adjusting these parameters allows for control over the length, thickness, density, and morphology of the nanowires.", "filepath": "abstracts/879/http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081012%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119141.html", "tokens_method=simple": ["silicon", "nanowires", "sinws", "potential", "applications", "include", "diodes", "transistors", "logic", "gates", "circuitry", "sensors", "sinws", "open", "possibility", "integrating", "optoelectronics", "microelectronics", "silicon", "semiconducting", "properties", "amorphous", "silicon", "nanowires", "shown", "emit", "blue", "light", "demonstrated", "sinws", "tunable", "electrical", "properties", "depending", "dopant", "range", "applications", "ability", "mass", "produce", "silicon", "nanowires", "simply", "easily", "source", "silicon", "needed", "substrate", "prove", "useful", "methods", "previously", "reported", "method", "involves", "production", "sinws", "lower", "temperature", "widely", "observed", "silicon", "substrate", "cleaned", "minutes", "ethanol", "followed", "acetone", "films", "thicknesses", "nm", "gold", "gold", "palladium", "deposited", "substrate", "physical", "vapor", "deposition", "serve", "growth", "center", "sinws", "samples", "placed", "furnace", "annealed", "c", "sccm", "flow", "argon", "atmospheric", "pressure", "scanning", "electron", "microscopy", "sem", "transmission", "electron", "microscopy", "tem", "characterization", "sinws", "resulting", "sinws", "amorphous", "structure", "convoluted", "lengths", "order", "tens", "microns", "diameters", "nm", "bed", "thickness", "approximately", "m", "effect", "varying", "gold", "concentration", "annealing", "time", "temperature", "gas", "flow", "rate", "investigated", "results", "discussed", "indicate", "adjusting", "parameters", "allows", "control", "length", "thickness", "density", "morphology", "nanowires"], "filename": "/Users/ryoungblood/topik/topik/tests/data/test_data_json_stream.json", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Rezina Siddique", " George Sirinakis", "Michael A.

A comprehensive set of long membranes made of various multilayers of silicon nitride and oxide films are fabricated and characterized. The out-of-plane deflection profile under pressure load is monitored by means of a laser profilometer. The pressure is stepped up until fracture occurs.

The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that the nanocrystals fabricated by the different methods are under optimized growth conditions single crystals of zincblende structure and of regular spherical shape. The average size was estimated to be between 2.0-3.0 nm with a size dispersion that depends on the synthesis route and is in the range between 10% and 20%. The XPS results indicate that for the nanoparticles obtained via solventless strategy the sulfur is present both as bonded to the metal atom and to the organic residue, while in the TOPO synthesized nanoparticles the sulfur signal has only one component associated to the metal-sulfide bond. The photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) analysis of CdS crystals clearly evidences the typical emissions of nanosized zincblende CdS monocrystalline particles.

A different way for nanoscaled composite formation is presented by the nanocrystallization of marginally glass-forming amorphous alloys, such as Al-rich alloys with rare earth and transition metal additions. Such composite systems that are stabilized at nanometer-scaled structure sizes due to diffusion limitations have conventionally been processed by supplying thermal energy for initiating the nanocrystal formation [2]. New opportunities for fabricating massive nanocrystalline composites in bulk quantities and with improved microstructures from such alloys might be based on the plastic deformation of the amorphous quenching products, as indicated by the observation of nanocrystallization in shear bands [3-5].ere, different deformation methods with largely different strain and pressure levels have been applied on rapidly quenched Al-rich metallic glasses in order to investigate the strain-induced nanocrystal formation. The results indicate e.g. that shear straining under a high pressure and to large strain values can produce uniform nanocrystalline structures in bulk samples, which is essential to their functional performance. Moreover, detailed structure analyses indicate that the amorphous structure of the entire sample volume, and not only the shear band regions, might be affected by the plastic deformation. In addition to the significance concerning the understanding of the deformation of glasses, the results also indicate the applicability of the new processing routes for synthesizing massive, porosity-free nanocrystalline materials.[1]\tG.

CNT length, orientation, and crystalline quality are controlled by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. With effective catalyst protection schemes, this fabrication process is very similar to the conventional approach for fabricating wafer-scale silicon AFM probe tips.

The function of these pastes is two-fold: (i) to transport heat away from the chip; and (ii) to accommodate mechanical stresses in the package arising from the mismatch in the thermal expansion between the chip and the heat spreader or sink. Due to the former requirement, thermal pastes are among some of the most highly-filled composite systems in practice (solids volume fraction > 70%).

The anisotropic microstructure of coatings is very sensitive to processing conditions and has significant influence on the properties. This study aims to understand the processing-microstructure-thermal property correlation of thermally sprayed coatings. Thermal transport properties of three coating systems forming composites with pores (yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) -Air), a second phase (Mo-Mo2C) and a graded material (YSZ-NiCrAlY) are interpreted from the point of view of microstructure and chemical composition. In the case of YSZ-Air composite, results indicate that porosity contribution from 20-35% decreases the thermal conductivity by 50-70% of the bulk value. For the intrinsic composite of Mo and Mo2C, which coexist as stable phases, thermal conductivity increases significantly with 1.75wt% carbon addition since it reduces formation of MoO2 during processing, but decreases with 3.5wt% carbon addition. This is attributed to larger carbide retention in the latter. For the discrete layered and graded composites of YSZ-NiCrAlY, which are made up of varying fractions of these two constituents,  thermal conductivity decreases sharply up to 40wt% YSZ and then more gradually with increasing YSZ content.

In order to utilize effectively these materials for M/NEMS applications, understanding of their microscopic structure and physical (mechanical properties, in particular) become indispensable. The micro- and nanocrystalline diamond films were grown using hot-filament and microwave chemical vapor deposition techniques involving novel CH4 / [TMB for boron doping and H2S for sulfur incorporation] in high hydrogen dilution chemistry.  To investigate residual stress distribution and intermolecular forces at nanoscale, the films were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in terms of topography, force curves and force volume imaging. Traditional force curve measures the force felt by the tip as it approaches and retracts from a point on the sample surface, while force volume is an array of force curves over an extended range of sample area. Moreover, detailed microscale structural studies are able to demonstrate that the carbon bonding configuration (sp2 versus sp3 hybridization) and surface chemical termination in both the un-doped and doped diamond have a strong effect on nanoscale intermolecular forces.

We have explored the reasons for this by correlating a wide range of variations in the basic microstructure with the wear behaviour observed, including both the wear rate, and quantitative surface fractography of the worn surfaces. These improved properties of the nanocomposites are shown to be a consequence of a reduction in surface grain pullout by brittle fracture. In \u201cdilute\u201d nanocomposites (<10% SiC), this is due largely to a reduction in size of the individual pullouts.

One of the major drawbacks of monolithic BMG materials is the limited ductility due to strain localization. Except a few recent reports on monolithic ductile BMG, the most popular method to enhance the ductility of the BMG samples is to introduce a crystalline or quasicrystalline phase by precipitation or mixing. The composite material usually exhibits some degree of strain hardening along with significantly higher impact resistance and fracture toughness. However, the mechanism of this strain hardening is not well understood. We present simulated uniaxial compression tests on a monatomic model amorphous system embedded with body-center cubic (BCC) nanocrystals. The advantage of this model system is that intimate amorphous-crystal interfaces can be obtained. We observe that when comparing to monolithic glassy samples where a single shear band normally dominates, multiple shear bands appear in the BCC-amorphous composite samples. The plastic deformation initiates at the interfaces between nanocrystals and the glassy phase due to stress concentration.

In this study, the isothermal section at 1000\u00b0C was evaluated in a series of alloys having nickel contents greater than 65 wt%. In Ni3Al, Fe can substitute for either Ni or Al in the ordered face-centered cubic lattice having an Ll2 structure. However, in substituting Fe for Ni one finds that the solubility limit is quickly exceeded at about 5 wt% Fe with the resultant formation of a ordered body-centered cubic (B2) phase at high temperature, which transforms martensitically upon quenching. Also, in substituting Fe for Al, the solubility limit is exceeded at about 5 wt% Fe with the formation of a disordered, face-centered cubic Ni-rich terminal solid solution. Thus, a very narrow range of alloy compositions exist where Fe can substitute for Ni and Al and preserve a single-phase L12 structure.

In building high field magnets, a variety of high strength composites are required because of the Lorentz stresses generated by high field exceeding the strength of most of the materials, particular conductors. For example, a field of 60 T can generate a magnetic pressure that corresponds to a stress in the conductor of 1.5 GPa, which is at the limit of known conducting materials with conductivity higher than 70% International Annealed Copper Standard and sizes suitable for building high field magnets. The design of high field magnets is limited by these forces and, consequently, by the available materials. At the same time, the materials need to have excellent physical properties.  For instance, the conductors need to have high electrical conductivity and high specific heat and the superconductors should have high critical current in field and low alternative current losses.
