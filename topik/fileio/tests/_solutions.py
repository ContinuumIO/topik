solution_json_stream = u"Transition metal oxides are being considered as the next generation materials in field such as electronics and advanced catalysts; between them is Tantalum (V) Oxide; however, there are few reports for the synthesis of this material at the nanometer size which could have unusual properties. Hence, in this work we present the synthesis of Ta2O5 nanorods by sol gel method using DNA as structure directing agent, the size of the nanorods was of the order of 40 to 100 nm in diameter and several microns in length; this easy method can be useful in the preparation of nanomaterials for electronics, biomedical applications as well as catalysts."

solution_large_json = u"Potential-function-based control strategy for path planning and formation control of Quadrotors is proposed in this work. The potential function is used to attract the Quadrotor to the goal location as well as avoiding the obstacle. The algorithm to solve the so called local minima problem by utilizing the wall-following behavior is also explained. The resulted path planning via potential function strategy is then used to design formation control algorithm. Using the hybrid virtual leader and behavioral approach schema, the formation control strategy by means of potential function is proposed. The overall strategy has been successfully applied to the Quadrotor's model of Parrot AR Drone 2.0 in Gazebo simulator programmed using Robot Operating System.\nAuthor(s) Rizqi, A.A.A.
