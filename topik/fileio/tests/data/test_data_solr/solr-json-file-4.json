Both fourth-generation poly (propyleneimine) (PPI) and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were suitable macromolecular hosts for the catalytic species. Average nanofiber diameters range from 10 - 15 nm, with lengths in excess of 20 microns.", "title": "Room-Temperature Growth of Carbon Nanofibers", "year": "1921", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081425%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119232.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Jason K.
