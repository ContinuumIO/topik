The synthesized ZnO nanowires have two typical average diameters: 60 nm in majority and 120 nm in minority. They are about 4\u00edm in length and well aligned along the normal direction of the substrate. Most of the synthesized ZnO nanowires are single crystalline in a hexagonal structure and grow along the [001] direction. The c-oriented ZnO thin films control the growth direction. Photoluminescence spectrum was measured showing a single strong ultraviolet emission (380 nm). Such result indicates that the ZnO nanowire arrays can be applied to excellent optoelectronic devices.", "title": "Synthesis of Well-aligned ZnO Nanowires Using Simple Physical Vapor Deposition without Catalysts or Additives", "year": "1956", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081564%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119268.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Lisheng Wang", " Xiaozhong Zhang", " Songqing Zhao", " Guoyuan Zhou", " Yueliang Zhou", "Junjie Qi"]}
