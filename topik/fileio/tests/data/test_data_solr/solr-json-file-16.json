In case of PZT, the process involves the preparation of metal ion complex (ligand) solution followed by evaporation. Complete evaporation results in fluffy dried mass. Calcination of dried mass at low temperature produces free-standing PZT nanoparticles. The concept of the process involves choice of correct metal ion complex, stoiochiometry and drying conditions to produce free-standing individual nanoparticles. Similar process has been used to prepare free-standing gold nanoparticles where individual gold form complex with the ligands (complexing agents) to produce free-standing nanoparticles.", "title": "Preparation of Free-Standing PZT and Gold Nanoparticles", "year": "1933", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081068%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119165.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["R.
