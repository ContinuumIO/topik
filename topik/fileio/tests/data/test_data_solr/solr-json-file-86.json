A very clean initial sample was chosen to avoid any residual catalyst and carbon impurities. Functionalized SWCNTs (f-CNTs) are deposited on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and this modified electrode is used for oxidizing the cofactor NADH (dihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in the presence of diaphorase. A clear electrocatalytic effect is evidenced, which can only be attributed to the f-CNTs.", "title": "Electrocatalytic effect towards NADH induced by HiPco single-walled carbon nanotubes covalently functionalized by ferrocene derivatives", "year": "2003", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8828130%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427413000845.html", "vol": "1531", "authors": ["Naoual Allali", " Veronika Urbanova", " Mathieu Etienne", " Martine Mallet", " Xavier Devaux", " Brigitte Vigolo", " Yves Fort", " Alain Walcarius", " Maxime No\u00ebl", " Edward McRae", " Alexander V.
