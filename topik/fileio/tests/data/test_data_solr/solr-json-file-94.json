It has been shown that the balance between the microalloy additions must be carefully controlled if the formation of very large precipitates in the cast slab is to be avoided. These large precipitates are very stable, some having been shown to be stable on reheating to about 1200\u00b0C and others are stable up to the melting point of the steel. The significance of these observations is briefly discussed in terms of the influence of these precipitates on the properties of the microalloyed steels.", "title": "EDX and EELS Analysis of Precipitates in HSLA Steels", "year": "2011", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8143051%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400447081.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["Z.
