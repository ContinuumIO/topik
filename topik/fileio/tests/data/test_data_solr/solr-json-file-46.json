Grain pullouts caused by intergranular fracture are observed on worn surfaces of alumina whereas only a few pullouts resulting from transgranular fracture and scratches caused by plastic deformation are the main features of a worn surface of the nanocomposites. Surface mechanical properties were investigated by Cr3+ fluorescence microscopy. The experiments were carried out using a variety of microstructures.", "title": "Residual Stresses around Indentations in Alumina/SiC Nanocomposites [Abstract + Supplemental Data]", "year": "1963", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161826%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057997.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Apichart Limpichaipanit", "Richard Ian Todd"]}
