In our synthesis route, ascorbic acid, natural vitamin C (VC), serves as both a reducing agent and an antioxidant to reduce copper salt precursor and effectively prevent the general oxidation process occurring to the newborn nanoparticles. XRD and UV/vis confirm the formation of pure face-centered cubic (fcc) copper nanoparticles and the excellent antioxidant ability of ascorbic acid.", "title": "Simple One-Step Synthesis of Uniform Disperse Copper Nanoparticles", "year": "1918", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081993%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119360.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["Chunwei Wu", " Brian P.
