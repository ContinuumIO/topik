Tests were performed both with a conventional and a synchrotron light source to analyze the elastic response of the system. Comparison between the strain-load curves obtained in both experimental conditions and estimated curves clearly shows that high quality synchrotron measurements are a preliminary condition for size-effect studies. Moreover, cyclic tests were used to determine the elastic domain of each material and compare their mechanical responses. Plastic strain was observed in copper while tungsten layers were still elastically strained until cracks appeared.", "title": "X-ray Diffraction Study of  the Mechanical Elastic Properties of Nanometric W/Cu Multilayers", "year": "1993", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161842%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS194642740005805X.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Pascale Villain", " Baptiste Girault", " Pierre-Olivier Renault", " Eric Le Bourhis", " Philippe Goudeau", "Frederic Badawi"]}
