For polymer-matrix composites that possess a segregated-network microstructure, the processing parameters can significantly impact the electrical properties and microstructure of the composite material. Our group has recently fabricated novel polymer-matrix nanocomposites, which possess a segregated network microstructure containing regular, polyhedral-shaped polymer matrix particles1-2. This paper investigates the effect of processing pressure and specimen thickness on the electrical properties and microstructure of hot pressed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) containing segregated networks of indium tin oxide (ITO) nanopowders.", "title": "Effect of Processing on the Microstructure and Electrical Conductivity of Hot Pressed PMMA/ITO Bulk Nanocomposites", "year": "1983", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161893%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS194642740005822X.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Charles J.
