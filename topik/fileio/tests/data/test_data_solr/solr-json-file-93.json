Tilting and high resolution experiments are particularly difficult. A survey of several investigations of microstructures in ferromagnetic materials ranging from pure iron to commercial magnet materials is presented. The topics of these investigations include determination of Burgers vectors and interstitial/vacancy character for dislocation loops, cavity shape analyses, magnetic domain/microstructure correlations, and characterization of structures resulting from isotropic spinodal decomposition. Problems encountered during these studies as they relate to magnetic materials and the modifications to standard microscope operating procedures required to overcome these problems are presented. This discussion includes specimen requirements, specimen loading and insertion, and alignment corrections required during specimen tilting.", "title": "Defect and Microstructural Analyses in Ferromagnetic Material", "year": "2010", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8142988%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400446877.html", "vol": "62", "authors": ["L.
