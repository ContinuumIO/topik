The residual stress can be minimized through controlling the processing path and the thermal environment. We studied the residual stress formation and evolution in gamma titanium aluminide (Ti-47AL-2Ta) matrix. The matrix was reinforced with three different types of fibers: Alumina, Sapphikon, and Tiboride through hot isostatic pressing. The composite was heat treated for various combinations of time: 100, 200 and 500 hours; and temperature: 590&#61616;C, 815&#61616;C and 982 &#61616;C respectively. Residual stresses were measured in the gamma phase of the matrix using X-Ray diffraction", "title": "Controlling Residual Stress in Metal Matrix Ceramic Fiber Composite", "year": "1981", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161797%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057882.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Marwan Al-Haik", " Hamid Garmestani", "Yousef Haik"]}
