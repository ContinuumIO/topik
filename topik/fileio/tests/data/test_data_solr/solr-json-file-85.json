If this energy can be exploited at the point where it is required, then the need to carry additional power sources can be reduced.  In recent years, magnetic shape memory alloys (MSMA) have demonstrated an ability to convert mechanical energy to magnetic energy.  Such conversions have lead to the investigation of these alloys for energy harvesting applications.", "title": "Polymer Assessment for Magnetic Shape Memory Alloy Composites", "year": "2002", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161905%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058267.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Royale S Underhill", " Gregory A Keddy", "Shannon P Farrell"]}
