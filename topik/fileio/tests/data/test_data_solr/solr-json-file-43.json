The resulting foam morphology was characterized by a detailed evaluation of foam density as well as of the cellular parameters. With regard to multiphase blends, transmission electron microscopic observations further provided a detailed insight into the cell wall morphology. The role of the melt-elongational properties and of the glass transition behavior of the various blend systems on the foaming characteristics was systematically elucidated. While the miscible blends showed a simple additivity behavior with regard to their foaming characteristics and properties, a significant influence of the initial blend morphology is demonstrated for the multiphase blends.", "title": "Foaming of Miscible and Immiscible Polymer Blends", "year": "1960", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161914%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400058292.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Holger Ruckdaeschel", " Julius Rausch", " Jan K.W.
