To study the grain size reduction mechanisms in multiphase structure subjected to SPD, two copper based composites (Cu-10%Fe and Cu-43%Cr) were severely deformed by torsion under high pressure. The grain size achieved with these composite materials is much smaller than in pure metals. It is for example in a range of 10 to 20 nm for the Cu-43%Cr composite, e.g. one order of magnitude lower than in pure Cu processed by SPD. Three dimensional atom probe data show also the formation of non equilibrium supersaturated solid solutions. The mechanisms of the deformation induced intermixing are discussed together with its influence on the mechanical properties.", "title": "Properties of Nanoscaled Multiphase Structures and Non-Equilibrium Solid Solutions Obtained by Severe Plastic Deformation [Abstract + Supplemental Data]", "year": "1991", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8161789%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400057857.html", "vol": "977", "authors": ["Xavier Sauvage", " Xavier Quelennec", " Peter Jessner", " Florian Wetscher", "Reinhard Pippan"]}
