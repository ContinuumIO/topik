Nanostructures are uniformly deposited on either bare or SiO2 thin film coated Si substrates via DC magnetron sputtering at 200-400\u00b0C using a 90% In2O3 / 10% SnO2 (ITO) target. The nanostructures are approximately 500 nm long, sit atop an accompanying underlying 100 nm conductive film, and are conically shaped, with a diameter of about 80 nm at the base, tapering to a point that is capped with a spherical \u201cball\u201d. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates a cubic In2O3 phase. Field emission from the tips is observed at a base pressure of 10-8 Torr with turn-on fields in a range between 45-75 V/cm and threshold fields from 64-105 V/cm. Nanocone growth is investigated with respect to O2 and Ar flow rates, temperature, power, pressure, wafer rotation, and time.", "title": "Characterization of Nanocones Grown During DC Magnetron Sputtering of an ITO Target", "year": "1942", "filename": "http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cambridge.org%2Faction%2FdisplayAbstract%3FfromPage%3Donline%26aid%3D8081826%26fulltextType%3DRA%26fileId%3DS1946427400119323.html", "vol": "879", "authors": ["J.F.
