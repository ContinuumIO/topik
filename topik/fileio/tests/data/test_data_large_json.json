Among them, bistable oscillators are especially of great potential. Many are realized with magnets and so are not well suited for miniaturization. This paper presents a novel bistable piezoelectric energy harvesting architecture without magnets. Modeling and design have been performed for this new architecture. A normalized expression is given so that the model is applicable to any scale. Chirp and band-limited noise excitations are used to evaluate the proposed harvester's performances. Numerical simulation and experimental tests are in good agreement and show that the new bistable generator has very good capabilities of combining large bandwidth and high output power.

During navigation, an image-based registration technique combined with robust outlier rejection is used to precisely locate the vehicle. The main objective of this work is to improve computational time by better representing and selecting information from the reference sphere and current image without degrading matching. It will be shown that by using this pre-learned global spherical memory no error is accumulated along the trajectory and the vehicle can be precisely located without drift.\nAuthor(s) Meilland, M.

Many social psychological studies have pointed out that intrinsic motivation is heightened through enhancing individual autonomy. However, managing individual autonomy in a work situation has not yet been adequately addressed nor discussed in detail. In this research, we investigated how to improve individual autonomy focusing on NPD personnel, such as those in design, development, manufacturing and quality-control, as well as in marketing departments. From questionnaire data collected from 242 NPD members within a Japanese industrial machine manufacturing company, we quantitatively analyzed the effects of various ways of giving autonomy to individuals. The results of this statistical analysis showed that individual autonomy was enhanced only when individuals could decide what they should accomplish in their work and how they should do their work. We revealed the importance of autonomy in motivating working professionals intrinsically, and how autonomy could be effectively given to individuals in a work situation. Also, we found that autonomy given to individuals had no direct effect on intrinsic motivation.\nAuthor(s) Horie, T. Grad. Sch. of Knowledge Sci., Japan Adv.

The aim of this system is to provide an effective alert mechanism when the temperature of the scenario goes beyond a critical value. The temperature change in each instant of the surrounding is fed into the database and here it is processed by the pc, which monitors it. Then if the parameter goes beyond a critical value, which can be calibrated initially, an alarm is turned on in the room to give a primary warning to the person in-charge of the locality. If there is no adequate response and the temperature is allowed to rise, an SMS (Short Message Service) notification is given via wireless modem to the responsible person. An emergency call is also made to the responsible person via the wireless modem and a recorded voice is played.

In this paper, a new autonomous component carrier (CC) selection scheme is proposed that dynamically selects the CC with efficient inter-cell signaling design. The CC selection criterion is to minimize the interference contribution composed of the incoming and outgoing interference. Additionally, power control and weighted proportional fair (PF) scheduling are used to further improve the cell-edge performance. The proposed inter-cell signaling between HeNBs is independent of CC number, user number and CC allocation results in HeNB network, thus the inter-cell signaling overhead can be greatly reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed CC selection scheme can autonomously achieve high cell-average and cell-edge throughput. This distributed and adaptive scheme performed locally at each HeNB is suitable for the uncoordinated HeNB deployment without centralized control unit.\nAuthor(s) Yuan Yan DOCOMO Beijing Commun.

Passive velocity field control (PVFC) is used as the underlying robot controller to map instantaneous levels of motor imagery during the movement to the speed of contour following tasks. In other words, PVFC changes the speed of contour following tasks with respect to intention levels of motor imagery. PVFC also allows decoupling of the task and the speed of the task from each other, and ensures coupled stability of the overall robot patient system.

Visualization addresses a key question of autonomic computing of how to win operators' confidence so that new tools will be embraced.

The resulting system is JAGR-JBoss with application-generic recovery - a self-recovering execution platform. JAGR combines application-generic failure-path inference (AFPI), path-based failure detection, and micro-reboots. AFPI uses controlled fault injection and observation to infer paths that faults follow through a J2EE application. Path-based failure detection uses tagging of client requests and statistical analysis to identify anomalous component behavior. Micro-reboots are fast reboots we perform at the sub-application level to recover components from transient failures; by selectively rebooting only those components that are necessary to repair the failure, we reduce recovery time.

In particular, the present work is focused on the development of technological support aimed at improving the daily life of that population segment who has motor difficulties, and is forced to use personal mobility support systems such as a wheelchair. This system is able to localize the wheelchair while it is moving in an indoor environment. The system exploits a low cost hardware and an integrated open source software, which permit a cheap integration with already available electric wheelchairs.\nAuthor(s) Cavanini, L.

However, robotic capabilities grow, the complexity of operating and interacting with such robots increases (such as through speech, gesture, scripting, or programming). Language-based communication can offer users the ability to work with physically and computationally complex robots without diminishing the robot's inherent capability. However, it remains an open question how to build a common ground between natural language and goal-directed robot actions, particularly in a way that scales with the growth of robot capabilities. We examine using semantic frames - a linguistics concept which describes scenes being acted out - as a conceptual stepping stone between natural language and robot action. We examine the scalability of this solution through the development of RoboFrameNet, a generic language-to-action pipeline for ROS (the Robot Operating System) that abstracts verbs and their dependents into semantic frames, then grounds these frames into actions. We demonstrate the framework through experiments with the PR2 and Turtlebot robot platforms and consider the future scalability of the approach.\nAuthor(s) Thomas, B.J. Dept. of Comput.

Being interested in specifying and verifying multiagent systems, we have decided to extend the GDT model for specifying Multiagent systems. The object of this article is to present this extension. So, after a brief description of the initial GDT model, we show how we extend it by introducing the specification of the whole MAS.

In two prior volumes, RAND has analyzed the United States' and United Nations' (UN's) performance in this sphere, examining instances in which one or the other led such operations. In this monograph, RAND looks at Europe's performance, taking six instances in which European institutions or national governments have exercised comparable leadership. To complete their survey of modern nation building, they have also included a chapter describing Australia's operation in the Solomon Islands. This is not a comprehensive study of all nation-building operations that have involved European countries. Rather, it is a study of the European role in six cases in which the European Union or a European government led all or a key part of such an operation: Albania, Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Bosnia. There are obvious difficulties in distinguishing among U.S.-, UN-, and European-led nation building, since many international peace operations involve the participation of all three. Nevertheless, it should make a difference whether military command is being exercised from Washington, New York, Brussels, Paris, or London. This study was intended to explore those differences. Previous volumes looked at the distinctive U.S. and UN approaches to these sorts of missions. This one seeks to determine whether there is an identifiable European way of nation building, and if so, what the United States can learn from it. In the final chapter, the authors compare the six European- and one Australian-led interventions covered in this volume with the 15 other U.S.- or UN-led operations described in their previous volumes. They use both quantitative and qualitative measures to compare inputs, including military personnel levels, economic assistance, and duration, and such outcomes as levels of security, economic growth, refugee return, and political reform achieved.","a":"ScholarlyArticle","name":"Europe's Role in Nation-Building: From the Balkans to the Congo","uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/article/dtic/7F2F782659C4135A05FFE0E7DBC2154173BF9AFA"},"uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/author/b.nora","alternateName":"Bensahel, Nora"}}

The goal of the Autonomous Sensor Network (ASN) project is twofold. First is to develop the rapidly deployable Noblis Autonomous Marine Sensor System (NAMSS) to demonstrate that more affordable and capable small sensor systems can be developed to significantly augment the currently expensive and limited number of systems in use. Second is to integrate NAMSS (and other existing operational sensor systems, both satellite and in situ) with emerging capabilities in the Noblis Sensor Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) along with geospatial analysis and visualization services to demonstrate the value of this enhanced capability. The ASN will be an automated observation, detection, alert, tasking, deployment, and product delivery system designed to allow domain users to react quickly and efficiently to a variety of emergent incidents, as well as improve the efficacy of longer-term monitoring, in estuarine and coastal marine waters. Noblis originated this project through internal corporate research and is working with partners in the Chesapeake Bay Observing System (CBOS) to build upon the initial work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center on the NASA Earth Observing (EO)-1 Sensor Web. The ASN will expand current EO-1 Sensor Web capabilities and extend them into the logistically and operationally challenging coastal marine and estuarine environment of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S. national marine sanctuaries, and other vitally important marine ecosystems. The ASN is intended to be a demonstration of the benefit of a rapid prototyping approach to exemplify the potential of CBOS and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).

Achieving advanced device self-managing (ADsM) capabilities in end to end reconfigurable mobile phone systems and networks is a central goal of E2R2, which is considered an inevitable next step in the evolution of today's management tools like the open mobile alliance (OMA) device management (DM). This framework is so far predominantly targeted towards the update of already sold mobiles by the device manufacturer. Another main aspect is the provisioning of operator dependent settings. Given the incredible rapid growth in network-size, complexity and considering desired abilities like dynamic spectrum management for spectrum-trading, moving the management plane to a higher abstraction layer is essential to keep track.

The drive system features a zero-radius steering capability to facilitate maneuvering over both land and water. This reduces vehicle dead weight, bulkiness and simplifies controller design. The automated guided system is placed within the compact body of the vehicle. The vehicle can switch to autonomous mode as required when in the confined or narrow areas.

Key characteristics of Flash Dissemination include unpredictability in its need, scalability to large number of recipients and autonomic performance in highly heterogenous and failureprone environments. Previous work either addresses large content delivery in heterogenous networks or fault-tolerant dissemination of (streaming) events. We investigate a peer-based approach using foundations from broadcast networks, gossip theory and random networks. In this paper, we propose CREW (Concurrent Random Expanding Walkers), a scalable, lightweight, and autonomic gossip-based protocol. CREW is also explicitly designed to maximize the speed of dissemination using adaptive and intelligent intra and inter node concurrency. We implemented CREW on top of a scalable middleware environment and compared it to optimized implementations of popular gossip and peer-based systems. Our experiments show that CREW outperforms both traditional gossip and current large content dissemination systems, across a wide range of comparative metrics, even though its design is counterintuitive from a systems perspective.\nAuthor(s) Deshpande, M.

Among them, electronic toll collection (ETC) systems based on user positions estimated with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are particularly attractive due to their flexibility and reduced roadside infrastructure in comparison to other systems such as tollbooths. Because GNSS positioning may be perturbed by different errors and failures, ETC systems, as liability critical applications, should monitor the integrity of GNSS signals in order to limit the use of faulty positions and the consequent charging errors. The integrity-monitoring systems have been originally designed for civil aviation; hence, they need to be adapted to the ETC requirements. This paper studies the use of receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), which are algorithms run within the GNSS receiver and, therefore, are easier to tune to ETC needs than other systems based on external information. The weighted least squares residual RAIM used in civil aviation is analyzed, and an algorithm modification for ETC is proposed. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed RAIM algorithm has a superior level of availability over civil-aviation-based RAIM procedures, particularly in urban environments.\nAuthor(s) Salos, D.

Historical background is provided on trait, environmentalist, and interactional theories which have guided past research. A multi-dimensional analysis of selected models of competence is provided to identify salient neglected aspects of the relationship of culture to competence. This analysis includes the variables of: (1) affect, (2) autonomy, (3) cognition, (4) motivation, (5) socialization, (6) stability, (7) process, (8) self-symbol formation, (9) the ethnocultural, (10) interactional, (11) interpersonal conceptual frameworks of competence (12) the Macro level, (13) micro level units of analysis for competence, the (14) the objective, and (15) subjective levels of competence.

To implement co-operation, a powerful behavioural control architecture, the behaviour synthesis architecture, has been developed, along with complementary sensor based communications and appropriate sensing and actuation systems.

While there are a number of applications in the nuclear, chemical and off-shore industries that would benefit from such technology, the required science and engineering is only just beginning to be realised. The key issues are firstly, how to control the interaction of these robots with themselves and their environment? and secondly, how to interact with this group of robots from the point of view of an operator? What has emerged is a novel hybrid architecture that contains a reflective planning agent which is capable of translating high level operator goals into low level behaviour missions that can be executed by multiple autonomous robots.

While the authors adopt the latter approach, both pose the problem of how to design the control architecture once the task becomes complex. This paper discusses automation approaches based on evolutionary techniques.

The research team includes three industrial collaborators for whom a number of potential commercial applications exist for the programme's emergent results. Initial work has involved an examination of these application areas and has led to the identification of a 'common denominator' research demonstrator. This involves object relocation using multiple mobile robots and is ideal as a laboratory test case encapsulating the majority of problems associated with multiple co-operating devices. The paper concludes with an overview of a number of platform additions that are planned as part of the on going research into mobile robot co-operancy.>\nAuthor(s) Barnes, D.P.

Therefore, this process optimization requires autonomous and versatile systems, such as Self-reconfigurable Modular Robots (SMR). The SMR are autonomous machines with variable morphology, therefore they have the potential to deal with this kind of problem. Reorganizing its parts connectivities, SMR offer major flexibility and tolerance to failure with a low cost. This work aims to present a review of the most recent SMR and design a low cost Reconfigurable Modular Robot with embedded sensors suitable for pipelines inspection, which reports the presence of obstacles and the position/orientation of each robot in the system.

The former phase, called feature selection, isolates among the quantities involved in the learning; while the latter phase designs an experiment considering only a reduced subset of variables.

Differencing individual UAV state estimates is not sufficiently accurate for close formation operations and must be augmented with vehicle-to-vehicle observations. To this end, we propose a quaternion based unscented Kalman filter to fuse information from each UAV sensor suite with relative vision observations. The result is a vastly improved relative state estimate that is resilient to brief vision dropouts and degrades gracefully during extended dropouts. Simulated formation flight results validate the approach and provide a numerical analysis of the algorithm performance. Ground based experiments demonstrate the algorithm running in real-time on a dual-UAV system. This represents a significant step towards an airborne implementation.\nAuthor(s) Wilson, D.B.

The limited spatial coverage and relative infrequency of such surveys compromise their value to fisheries managers. The Liquid Robotics Wave Glider allows scientists to collect data in a wider range of weather conditions and using fewer man-hours than typical shipboard acoustic surveys while operating at a greatly reduced cost. As part of an NSF-sponsored research project, Cornell University, BioSonics, Inc. and Liquid Robotics collaborated to design and manufacture a custom tow-body containing a specially modified dual-frequency BioSonics echosounder with 70-kHz and 200-kHz transducers. The tow body was attached to the submerged glider unit of a Liquid Robotics Wave Glider with a compliant tow cable to provide mechanical isolation between the Wave Glider and the tow body. Liquid Robotics conducted a series of tests in Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, during March 2011 and March 2012 with the goal of evaluating the ability of the system to detect the mesopelagic boundary community's (MBC) offshore to onshore and upward vertical migration. The system was shown to be an effective method for collecting high-quality acoustic data for studying patterns in the distribution and migration of marine organisms. It also holds great promise for applications oriented towards continuous assessment of commercial fish stocks and the monitoring of marine ecosystem health.\nAuthor(s) Meyer-Gutbrod, E.

The work is motivated by the desire to obtain cross-shore hydrographic transects that would provide estimates of the transport of relatively dense, salty water from the Chukchi Sea to the Arctic Ocean in winter. The horizontal scales (~10 km), maximum water depths (~100 m) and desired measurements (temperature, salinity and velocity vs. depth) in the study region match the capabilities of a small AUV such as the REMUS-100. It was recognized that achieving the science goals would require increasing the range of acoustic navigation and communication as well as developing a robust approach to through-ice deployment and recovery. These needs drove three modifications to the AUV: (1) Incorporation of a lower frequency (10 kHz) transducer and associated hardware for navigation and communication, (2) Addition of special-purpose sensors and hardware in a hull extension module, (3) Development of a homing algorithm utilizing an Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) array in the AUV nose cap. In March 2010, eight days of field work offshore of Barrow provided successful demonstration of the system. A total of 14 km of track lines beneath a coastal ice floe were obtained from four missions, each successfully terminated by net-capture recovery.\nAuthor(s) Kukulya, A. Woods Hole Oceanogr.

HRV in 20 healthy full-term neonates was compared to HRV recorded in healthy young adults. Besides traditional time and frequency domain measures, we assessed HRV complexity measures including normalized complexity index (NCf), normalized unpredictability index (NUPf), pattern classification (OV%, 1 V%, 2LV%, 2UV%) and multiscale irreversibility indices (P%, G%, E). HRV magnitude was significantly decreased in the neonatal group compared to the adults. HR V complexity measures, i.e. indices NCf, NUPf and pattern indices 1 V%, 2LV%, were also significantly reduced. Pattern classification parameter OV% and Porta's irreversibility index P% showed significant increase in newborns compared to adults suggesting the shift in the sympathovagal balance of neonates towards sympathetic predominance. Moreover, surrogate data analysis of irreversibility indices revealed asymmetrical nature of the HRV series present already in the neonatal age suggesting the nonlinear nature of HR V dynamic even very shortly after birth.\nAuthor(s) Czippelova, B.

These protocols are, however, complicated by the fact that they require strict transmitter synchronization in order for the carrier signals from each source to arrive in phase and constructively combine at the intended destination. This paper develops an explicit method for synchronizing the carriers of two sources in a cooperative communication system with one destination. Unlike the prior work in this area, the approach described in this paper allows for source and/or destination mobility. The performance of the proposed carrier synchronization system is investigated for several channel models and practical design considerations are also discussed.\nAuthor(s) Brown, D.R., III Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

The case of a two degree of freedom, two link, planar arm is then considered in detail. A discrete time model matching adaptive controller is then derived using a specific descretization of the continuous time nonlinear dynamics. Conditions which guarantee global stability of the control scheme are derived for the case of controlling the descretized model, and simulations are presented for the case of controlling the actual continuous time dynamics.\nAuthor(s) Elliott, H.

However it is difficult to maintain this beneficial effect in open and unpredictable systems. Such systems seem to require a \" bespoke \" (that is, a new) design for cooperation in each domain. Recent work in artificial life and biological sciences has identified novel \" tag \" mechanisms for the spontaneous self-organization of group level adaptations in populations of autonomous agents [2, 3, 13, 16]. We summarize these findings and identify a key application (in MAS) to which these mechanisms may be fruitfully applied. An intriguing aspect of these mechanisms is that (in certain circumstances) there is a negative scaling cost – that is, the more agents in a system the better and more quickly organized they become. Also, since the process is driven by individual (bounded) optimization, agents retain a high degree of autonomy but still evolve behaviors that are socially rational even in open systems. Initial results indicate that the harnessing of such a process in MAS may be a viable alternative to the engineering of specific cooperation mechanisms and group structures.","a":"ScholarlyArticle","name":"Evolving Social Rationality for MAS using \" Tags \"","uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/article/jpl/http_3A_2F_2Fdl_acm_org_2Fft_gateway_cfm_3Fid_3D860655_26amp_3Bftid_3D208898_26amp_3Bdwn_3D1_26amp_3BCFID_3D622551673_26amp_3BCFTOKEN_3D42643781"},{"sourceOrganization":[{"location":{"a":"Place","name":"Manchester"},"a":"Organization","name":"Manchester Metropolitan University"},{"location":{"a":"Place","name":"Manchester"},"a":"Organization","name":"Centre for Policy Modelling"}],"citation":[{"author":{"a":"Person","name":"P.

Despite the use and formalization of context being extensively studied both in AI and ML, context has not been much utilized in agents. This may be because many agents are only applied in a single context, and so these aspects are implicit in their design, or it may be that the need to explicitly encode information about various contexts is onerous. An algorithm to learn the appropriate context along with knowledge relevant to that context gets around these difficulties and opens the way for the exploitation of context in agent design.

The hypothesis is that intelligence, as something what assumes the understanding, creativity and self-improving, should rely on the learning ability. Planning of intelligent robot behavior addresses three main issues: finding task solutions in unknown situations, learning from experience and recognizing the similarity of problem paradigms. The presented behavior based model integrates perception, recognition, problem solving and learning capabilities. The reinforcement learning method is used here to evaluate robot behavior and to induce new, or improve the existing, knowledge. The acquired action (task) plan is stored as experience which can be used in solving similar future problems. To provide the recognition of problem similarities, the adaptive fuzzy shadowed (AFS) neural network is applied.

An important part of the work is to build a simulation tool, which enables the designer to generate efficient motion and can be used as a basis for motion control. The modeling and simulation tool MOSES was developed for planar motion, where the wheels drive the articulated body and coordinated bending of several active joints causing spatial motion. The simulation is based on the fact that the real system will move in such a way that only a minimum of energy is required\nAuthor(s) Linnemann, R. German Nat. Res. Center for Inf.

In this paper, we review the SoS literature to illustrate the need to create an SoSE management framework based on the demands of constant technological progress in a complex dynamic environment. We conclude from this review that the history and evolution of defining SoS has shown that: (1) SoS can be defined by distinguishing characteristics and (2) SoS can be viewed as a network where the ldquobest practicesrdquo of network management can be applied to SoSE. We use these two theories as a foundation for our objective to create an effective SoSE management framework. To accomplish this, we utilize modified fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security (FCAPS) network principles (SoSE management conceptual areas). Furthermore, cited distinguishing characteristics of SoS are also used to present a SoSE management framework.

To utilize these characteristics, concrete definitions are presented in context and then applied to the development of a theoretical model.

These technologies are not ready to compete with the internal combustion engine and electric motors in high power propulsion systems but are suitable for intermittent or aperiodic applications with moderate cycle life requirements, providing an alternative to solenoids and direct drive electric motors. Polypyrrole, an emerging actuator material, is applied to drive hydrodynamic control surfaces and in particular to change the camber of a foil. The foil is intended for use in the propeller blade of an autonomous underwater vehicle. A scaled prototype is constructed which employs polypyrrole actuators imbedded within the blade itself to vary camber. The kinematics required to generate camber change are demonstrated, with >30° deflections of the trailing edge being observed from both bending bilayer and linear actuator designs. Forces developed in still conditions are five times lower than the 3.5 N estimated to be required to implement variable camber. The observed 70 kJ/m3 polypyrrole work density however is more than sufficient to produce the desired actuation from within the limited blade volume, enabling an application that is not feasible using direct drive electric motors. A key challenge with the polypyrrole actuators is to increase force without sacrificing speed of actuation.\nAuthor(s) Madden, J.D.W.

We investigate the causes of LRD traffic in network systems, which may result from traffic correlation, protocol behavior (e.g., retransmissions), and network congestion; and statistically analyzed the properties of LRD traffic from empirical data sets. We develop a unifying theory for network control that exploits the interactions across network functionalities, operates at appropriate time-scales, and is effective in the presence of LRD. We formulate optimization and distributed control problems for providing network services, and study the impact of LRD traffic on network control, performance, and security. We also develop an integrative approach that combines the LRD modeling and network control to obtain non-parametric or semi-parametric techniques for the distributed detection of information flow and flow changes needed for preventing security attacks.

During their cooperation the collision is expected only between the robot end-effector and the lower arm of the human worker. To ensure safe and comfortable human-robot interaction the impact must not cause any injury or considerable pain to the human operator. An investigation with human volunteers was performed, to study the impact between the robot and the man. To determine a safe range of the impact intensity with human subjects, a preliminary investigation was performed on one of the authors of this paper. During the experiment, the volunteers determined the pain they felt after each impact using a graphical user interface. In the experiments, the robot end-effector collided with the volunteer's lower arm perpendicularly at a constant deceleration. The point of impact was positioned midway between the wrist and the elbow on the dorsal aspect of the lower arm. The robot end-effector was displaced from the initial point toward the point of impact along a straight line. Several tests were carried out at maximal velocity, different robot decelerations, various end- effector shapes, and varying depth of stop point with regard to the arm surface. The impacts between robot end-effector and human arm were evaluated using a measuring system comprised of a force sensor and an optical measuring system. The goal of the investigation was to determine the correlation between the pain intensity felt during the impact and the impact energy density.\nAuthor(s) Povse, B.

Pushing an object for instance by a fence, can be employed to accurately align parts, reducing uncertainty to only one degree of freedom. In this paper a pushing task involving two fingers that completely constrains an object in a plane is proposed. The stability of orientation and position of an object being pushed is discussed. The solution obtained is unique despite the fact that the distribution of forces supporting the object cannot, in general, be known. The proposed task of pushing is simple although some preliminary information about the initial position and orientation of an object is required. An approach to avoid the ambiguity in orientation, owing to the effect of friction between the object and the pusher, by introducing up and down movement of the pusher is also presented\nAuthor(s) Balorda, Zdravko Fac. of Electr. & Comput.

Cardiovascular treadmill training, which has been shown to provide great benefit to stroke survivors, cannot be performed with non-ambulatory patients. We therefore integrated cardiovascular training in robot-assisted gait therapy to combine the benefits of both training modi. We developed a model of human heart rate as a function of exercise parameters during robot-assisted gait training and applied it for automatic control purposes. This structural model of the physiological processes describes the change in heart rate caused by treadmill speed and the power exchanged between robot and subject. We performed physiological parameter estimation for each tested individual and designed a model-based feedback controller to guide heart rate to a desired time profile. Five healthy subjects and eight stroke patients were recorded for model parameter identification, which was successfully used for heart rate control of three healthy subjects. We showed that a model-based control approach can take into account patient-specific limitations of treadmill speed as well as individual power expenditure.\nAuthor(s) Koenig, A. Dept. of Mech.

The increased availability of high-speed wired and wireless data networks is promoting the use of immersive environments, but there is not enough evidence yet to support whether such environments significantly improve the field-tested performance of tele-operation systems or not. We are interested in investigating a mixed-presence, tele-operation scenario involving an offsite operator remotely operating a robot as well as an onsite operator co-located with the robot. These scenarios are common in industry, yet poorly researched. We have conducted a trial to explore the effects of immersion on operator spatial awareness, sense of presence and satisfaction, in a mixed presence tele-operation scenario. This paper presents the results of our trial using a panoramic display system that provides some level of immersion.

A successful manipulation model requires cost-effective robots, robust hardware, and proper system feedback and control. This paper details key sensing and manipulator capabilities of the r-one robot. The r-one robot is an advanced, open source, low-cost platform for multi-robot manipulation and sensing that meets all of these requirements. The parts cost is around $250 per robot. The r-one has a rich sensor suite, including a flexible IR communication/localization/obstacle detection system, high-precision quadrature encoders, gyroscope, accelerometer, integrated bump sensor, and light sensors. Two years of working with these robots inspired the development of an external manipulator that gives the robots the ability to interact with their environment. This paper presents an overview of the r-one, the r-one manipulator, and basic manipulation experiments to illustrate the efficacy our design. The advanced design, low cost, and small size can support university research with large populations of robots and multi-robot curriculum in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. We conclude with remarks on the future implementation of the manipulators and expected work to follow.\nAuthor(s) McLurkin, J. Comput. Sci.

The integration of all these different devices, and interfaces, as well as the automated analysis and representation of all the pieces of information are current key challenges in telemedicine. Mobile phone technology has just begun to offer great opportunities of using this diverse information for guiding, warning, and educating patients, thus increasing their autonomy and adherence to their prescriptions. However, most of these existing mobile solutions are not based on platform systems and therefore represent limited, isolated applications. This article depicts how telemedical systems, based on integrated health data platforms, can maximize prescription adherence in chronic patients through mobile feedback.

This paradigm is equally applicable to potentially hazardous or inaccessible operational areas on Earth such as those related to military or terrorist activities, or areas that have been exposed to biochemical agents, radiation, or natural disasters. Traditional missions have performed local, ground-level reconnaissance through rovers and immobile landers, or global mapping performed by an orbiter. The former is safety and engineering constrained, affording limited detailed reconnaissance of a single site at the expense of a regional understanding, while the latter returns immense datasets, often overlooking detailed information of local and regional significance.\nAuthor(s) Fink, W.

This is due to a large number of control parameters, unexpected changes of the network topology, and dynamic application requirements. Network management is also a challenging task for the remote user due to the large-scale of the network and scarce visibility of live network happenings. Preferably the network should have autonomous decision-making capabilities as network conditions and application requirements change. In this paper, we consider Octopus, a tool that provides live information about the network topology and sensor data. The tool provides monitoring and visualisation functionality to the user. In the original version of the system, network state was controlled manually. This paper describes how Octopus has been reengineered to accommodate a multi-agent system to provide autonomic managing capabilities. In particular, we detail two distinct architectures, the static and mobile agent architectures, which can be effectively applied to deliver autonomous system management.\nAuthor(s) Ruzzelli, A.G.

This work aims to develop autonomous cooking systems which are able to provide a better cooking practice while increasing the energy efficiency of existing hobs. In this paper, we will present fuzzy logic based agents which could be embedded in normal hobs converting them to intelligent and more energy efficient ones. The realised system is able to self-regulate the heating during the most widely used cooking techniques including boiling, deep-frying, stir-frying, warming and melting. The agent is also capable of identifying when the user intervention is needed where the system continuously controls the cooking pot temperature preventing it from reaching unwanted values and detects when a pan boils-dry switching the appliance off immediately. We will present various real world experiments where it will be shown that the developed intelligent hob is capable of performing autonomous cooking to the satisfaction of the human user(s) while providing an energy saving of around 15-20% when compared to the human cooking practice.\nAuthor(s) Ghelli, A.

Idealized robots are able to instantaneously move in any direction, and are equipped with perfect range sensors. In this study, the formation problem of distributed mobile robots that are subject to physical constraints is addressed. Mobile robots considered in this study have physical dimensions and their motions are governed by physical laws. They are equipped with sonar and infrared range sensors. The formation of lines and circles by using the potential field method is investigated in detail. It is demonstrated that line and circle algorithms developed for idealized robots do not work well for physical robots. New line and circle algorithms, with consideration of physical robots and sensors, are presented and validated through extensive simulations. Movement in formation of a small group of physical mobile robots is also studied. An algorithm is developed using the potential field method that makes robots move through a workspace filled with many obstacles while maintaining the formation.","a":"ScholarlyArticle","name":"Geometric Formation With Uniform Distribution and Movement in Formation of Distributed Mobile Robots.","uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/article/dtic/BF068835A21120A2A2B2DC090072666B7BBAC4A7"},"uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/author/a.gokhan","alternateName":"Alptekin, Gokhan"}}

While improvement and perfection of aerodynamic methods may be a more desirable approach, there is a practical limit to these methods, and the use of ground contact devices requires consideration for providing more positive directional control. Wheels deserve special attention, and therefore are analyzed in more detail because of their obvious application on a variety of land terrains. Brake rods and harrows are more suitable on water, ice and snow. The saucer-shaped ground contact device would cause the least ecological impact on fragile organic terrains such as tundra. Relative directional stability is evaluated in terms of the total yawing moments produced by wheel arrangements (single, dual, tandem), location on the vehicle, and operational modes (free-rolling, braked, or a combination of the two). The available moments are plotted against the yaw angle of the vehicle to determine the most effective operational mode with a particular wheel arrangement for any yaw condition. The analysis is limited to retractable devices which act as moment producing brakes or rollers and do not serve as either propulsion or load support aids. Controlled ground contract with skirt sections having special wearing surfaces may provide a suitable control method and would require the least significant change to the basic design of the vehicle or its components. The concept involves the use of an air flow control mechanism for deflating specific skirt sections.","a":"ScholarlyArticle","name":"Air Cushion Vehicle Ground Contact Directional Control Devices.","uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/article/dtic/C93AA3BFFB2A07FEC9DA933C96F35B6AE6B20D70"},"uri":"http://dig.isi.edu/autonomy/data/author/a.gunars","alternateName":"Abele,Gunars"}}
